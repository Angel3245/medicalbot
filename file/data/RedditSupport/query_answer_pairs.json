        "question": "Boyfriend commented on the amount of food I made us for dinner, and I feel so upset I have been working with my nutritionist for a while, and over the last 6 months talking about how to manage going back to the gym.\r\n\r\nI haven\u2019t been to the gym in a very long time, because I know what it does to me. It makes me panicked about why I am there, why I waited so long, I fixate immediately on everything I ate or will eat, etc. everything goes into hyperdrive.\r\n\r\nToday I finally went, with guidance from my nutritionist. I am proud of myself for coming home, and still having a favorite beer...It\u2019s Friday, after all. I made a (half) joke to my partner about wasting my gym time on just this can here.\r\n\r\nHe proceeds to add on to that statement, that I made us both such giant salads for dinner... and he really could have had a third less even.\r\n\r\nIt just entirely destroyed me inside. He knows about my bulimia, but I don\u2019t express the struggle I am always going through. I am far along in my recovery, but still have plenty of bad days. \r\n\r\nI feel like I am not sick enough anymore for him to understand or take it seriously. He kept expounding on how much was in the salad, and it really hurt me inside. I felt good about the things in it, and he can always make his own salad if he wants I was just trying to be nice.\r\n\r\nHe\u2019s asleep so I haven\u2019t talked to him yet, and I just excused myself from the table at the time. \r\n\r\nI think I\u2019m just upset because in that moment I needed support, not criticism. Also it was a salad. He has said before he thinks I eat too much the few times we\u2019ve talked about it, and I don\u2019t think he realizes how destructive that language is :(\r\n\r\nI think I\u2019m being overly sensitive but I am still just very upset. I grew up with all my food being restricted and monitored, and don\u2019t want that for my current life. I know it\u2019s in part paranoia that I\u2019m being watched and judged, but that type of comment just feels affirming in my concerns.\r\n\r\nNot sure what to do, any advice is appreciated.",
        "answer": "First off, you're not being overly sensitive. You have a right to have feelings about what he said.\r\n\r\nAlso, it sounds like he may have a skewed view of eating healthy if he thinks it was unhealthy just because there was a lot of it. \r\n\r\nIt sounds like you may need to set some boundaries with him when it comes to talking about food and dieting and such.\r\n\r\nDefinitely talk to him and keep an eye out to see if he corrects himself. Many people recovering from eating issues have people that would hold them back on purpose just to keep in control of that person.",

        "question": "How to stop an ED before it starts? Throwaway account for obvious reasons. I tried to post this a few months ago but never really plucked up the courage because I was in denial about having an issue, but I think I need some help - preferably from people who have some perspective on the issue.\r\n\r\nFor context, I used to be overweight and decided to go on a diet last year due to joint problems. Losing the weight felt great in terms of self confidence and general mobility but I realised once I hit my current, healthy weight, I got depressed about my results not being 'good enough'. I find myself hyper-analysing my body constantly and thinking I 'need' to fit into certain clothing sizes and taking huge blows to my self confidence if I don't. During my initial weight loss, counting calories wasn't a big deal to me but now I'm obsessed.\r\n\r\nThe thing that actually triggered me to post this is when tonight after dinner, I frantically rushed around the kitchen picking up all the food items I had eaten that day and tallied up how much everything was. I even picked a packet out of the trash to do it.\r\n\r\nNobody in my life knows I do this, not even my partner who I consider my closest friend. I hide it from everyone because I'm afraid that if I tell anybody then I'll be forced to eat too much and gain weight (I had an issue with my parents doing this to me in childhood). I know my current behaviour isn't normal but I haven't tipped fully into purging/restricting/etc. so I feel like I have some time to prevent what's going on if I know how to. The articles online are focused more so on people who are actively dealing with EDs, which is understandable.\r\n\r\nAny help is really appreciated. I know a lot of people with mental health issues/addictions always wish they could've given their younger self some advice so if anybody has anything, please do tell.",
        "answer": "Hi there,\r\n\r\nI work with people with ED. I can imagine what you're experiencing is very mentally taxing. \r\nI like to ask people to imagine their ED as a voice in their head, talking to them and commanding them to do certain things. You're there as well and fighting against it, but sometimes, it wins the argument and you're then forced to do what it says. I'm sure part of you wanted to just be normal after your dinner, but your ED (or the beginning of, or whatever you want to call it) ordered you to go count every calorie, and it succeeded in that instance.\r\nI hear that it hasn't gotten to the point where it's making you adopt purgatory behaviors, but I want you to realize that you've already entered into a phase of restriction. You can look up the binge-restrict cycle if you're not familiar with it. It's not a healthy cycle to be in. Eventually, the ED can become stronger and weaken your own will to stay healthy.\r\nHow to get rid of it ? First, you need to understand that healing from ED is a non-linear process. There will be relapses, and it's normal and it's okay. \r\nYou will also need to build a network around you. ED is not something you can fight on your own. I know it might be hard to even imagine telling people at this point, but the people that really love you will care and be there to support you through this, there's no doubt about that. Allow them to be there for you.\r\n\r\nA good ressource I like to recommend is the book Life without ED by Jenni Schaefer. The author talks about her experience getting rid of her ED. I think it could be a good start for you. You can also look into support groups in your area. They're usually free services offered by non-profits, and you could get to share with people living similar experiences.\r\n\r\nRemember the first step is to acknowledge there's a problem, and you've achieved that already, you can be very proud of yourself. Keep loving yourself, and best of luck :)",

        "question": "Struggling to stop using cocaine, could use some support I had done coke a few times before at parties etc when offered, but last summer I started buying my own. At first it was purely recreational, I liked feeling more confident and going out to dance with a bag in my pocket. Mostly weekends, sometimes I'd get a bag and go out on a weeknight, and it'd last me a couple of days. \r\n\r\nWell fast forward a couple of months, and it started catching up with me. Tired all the time, depressed, no motivation, work performance slipping. That was the tipping point where I should have stopped. Instead, I started bringing it to work, where I'd dip out of the office every hour or so for bumps in the bathroom. I was basically self medicating my ADHD with coke instead of Adderall. \r\n\r\nOf course, I didn't stop using when the work day ended. I'd get home, go to the bar and make conversation with strangers in between trips to the bathroom.\r\n\r\nThat was back in September. I've been going through a gram a day for about 4 months now, and I'm paying the price. I really want to stop, but during the week I'm afraid I won't be able to function at work, and when the weekend rolls around I just wind up partying again.\r\n\r\nIm thinking of taking a personal day this Friday, deleting my dealers number and taking the long weekend to jump start my recovery. I'm going to delete my dealer's number, try my best to go to the gym or at least do some walking outside, pick some comfort movies to watch - if you want to drop any more tips I'd be grateful.\r\n\r\nMuch love to you all!",
        "answer": "Hi there. What a deja vu. I\u2019ve seen this movie and I know how it ends\u2026 \r\n\r\nIn my case it was 2016. I was at the same spot\u2026 In a span of two weeks, work got so stressful, I did so much coke one night that I could not get out of my room next morning. Had to call in sick. And again. And again. I lost control. I lost the job. \r\n\r\nCocaine addiction can escalate pretty fast. I spent about two years (2015/2016) in heavy addiction. I mean heavy. Four day benders. Almost oded a few times. Nothing made me stop, until I lost my job and it hit me in the face.\r\n\r\nI tried to quit on my own for a while, I spent three months in bed eating and sleeping and fighting the urge to go out and buy more. Then I had a nasty relapse. I only got the grip on recovery when I started seeing a therapist. She helped me get my life back on track.\r\n\r\nSo my tip, from someone that has been in the ups and downs of coke recovery since 2016, is get professional help. Go to a group or get a therapist, or a doctor. It\u2019s so much easier and effective when you have someone guiding you. \r\n\r\nBe patient and be strong. It took me several months to stop shaking and feeling dizzy out of the blue. I felt numb and stuck for a long time, until I started going on long morning walks, that really changed everything. Go to bed early, try to go for walks in the sun, lots of sun, eat heathy (but keep ice cream in hand, ice cream is wonderful to cut the cravings) and keep busy during the day. Keep so busy that when party time comes you are so tired, all you want is a good night sleep. You will thank yourself in the morning.\r\n\r\nAlso I had to change all of my friends. I only felt really free from coke in 2021. I almost slipped back during 2020\u2026 Had to let go of all my party people. Up until this day, I don\u2019t trust myself around coke, so I avoid people and places where I know there will be blow.  \r\n\r\nThe hardest thing you already did, that is admitting you have a problem. You can do this. Trust me, it\u2019s worth it. Life is so much better without cocaine. \r\n\r\nGood luck!!",

        "answer": "Therapist here! No worries! Theres lot of things you can do to keep youself calm, depending on what works for you.   \r\n\r\n\r\nMusic therapy - youtube or spotify relaxing and calming music to help you reduce your heart rate and calm your breathing if your anxiety gets bad. Take your time with it.   \r\n\r\n\r\nJournal - write down your anxious thoughts. what worries you the most, is anything else bothering you, are you catastrophizing?   \r\n\r\n\r\nTalk it out - do you have a family member, friend or classmate that would be willing to listen to you vent and air your concerns?   \r\n\r\n\r\nTherapy - if its within finanical reason, consider speaking to a therapist!  \r\n\r\n\r\nDissociation - I love using this technique. You know that little voice in your head that tell you youll fail, there isnt enough time, youll get kicked out of school, your parents will be so dissapointed etc etc? I cannot stress this enough, this voice is not you! Just becuase you hear it in your head does not mean it is true. A good method for this is one of my favorites. Imagine for a moment that you are sat on a sofa, and this voice in your head saying all this negativity is another person sat with on on this couch. Listen to them talk. Listen to how they ramble on and on about all this negative stuff. Its getting tiring, annoying and frustrating. So walk away! It sounds silly to some, but making this kind of distinction of \"I am ME and I am NOT my thoughts\" is an incredibly useful tool.   \r\n\r\n\r\nMeditation or self hypnosis - as a hypnotherapist, i may be bias here, but hear me out! Meditation and self hypnosis is an incredible tool to ease mental health and stress issues. There are many guided tools available online, you just have to find one that speaks to you!   \r\n\r\n\r\nI hope this helps you!",

        "question": "Too Anxious to Play Competitive Online Games  Hi all, I\u2019ve had this issue for a long time now, probably ever since mid-college, but I\u2019m not sure where it started exactly. Right now I\u2019m out of university, been in the workforce for about 4 years, working from home mostly. \r\n\r\nI know you read the title and it sounds silly, but it\u2019s actually really affecting my life.\r\n\r\nI used to be a really competitive person- I really liked it when I would go online, play for hours, beat people down, win games, and improve my skills. But lately, when I try to get into a competitive game (basically any game with a ladder/ELO matchmaking system), I become almost paralyzed with fear at pressing the \u201cStart Match\u201d or \u201cFind a Match\u201d button. \r\n\r\nI\u2019ll finally get some free time away from family or work, and I\u2019ll be like, \u201cOk, I really want to improve at this game.\u201d I\u2019ll sit down and just watch my mouse hover over the \u201cStart Match\u201d button for what seems like hours. I\u2019ll end up watching like dozens of Youtube videos on random garbage.\r\n\r\nIn the end, I\u2019ll either just play one or two games, and it\u2019ll be like 3:00 AM so I have to sleep, so I\u2019ll stop. **And for those games, my heart will be beating out of my chest, I\u2019ll sweat like crazy, my hands will shake. It\u2019ll look like I just came off a jog outside or something.**  \r\n\r\nThen, I can\u2019t sleep. My mind feels like I haven\u2019t completed what it set out to do, so I\u2019m restless for hours. I\u2019ll end up sleeping at ridiculous times like 5 or 6 AM on a workday.\r\n\r\nSo then after the weekend or the follow workday, I\u2019ll feel so unsatisfied or unrested. Then the cycle repeats.  \r\n\r\nMy friends will talk about how they were able to *relax* and play dozens of games in one sitting. I see streamers and youtubers just instantly play one game after another, no hesitation. And I\u2019m sitting here like *how?* Like, what\u2019s wrong with me? \r\n\r\nIt\u2019s so stupid. There should be nothing to be afraid of. Yet my body reacts like I\u2019m about to box 10 rounds or something. \r\n\r\nBut even though I have this insane reaction towards playing, these games are still *so much fun.* It\u2019s so satisfying to win, or even lose and try to learn what I need to improve on. Even when I get beat down, it\u2019s exhilarating. I want to keep having this fun without feeling like crap.\r\n\r\nAnyone else experience something like this? Was anyone ever able to get over it? Let me know!",
        "answer": "Similar but different situation going on with me. Was never a competitive guy but would be able to spend 4 hours plus playing a story based game. Now I can't get myself to sit down for long enough to make any progress. It used to be an escape for me but now it's just depressing that I don't have any interest in doing what I love (other hobbies as well).\r\n\r\nFunnily enough I've been able to play MW2 with some friends most nights, I found that the quick nature of it didn't stress me out as much as the thought of committing hours to something. Not sure why as I haven't liked multiplayer shooters since World at War.\r\n\r\nSounds like we may have traded a little I guess.",

        "answer": "That is something you have to admit truthfully to yourself. As someone who works with addicts, and is personally affected by life with an addict-there is no point in others telling you you have a problem. You have to find that truth in yourself and admit that you are powerless over cocaine. Being powerless doesn't mean you can't quit, it means you know that one is too many, and a thousand is never enough. If you can't put it down, and one line is never enough, you know you don't have power over cocaine, cocaine has power over you. If you feel this is true, then there is hope and there is an answer-sobriety. \r\n\r\nLife without that cocaine can be beautiful, and the cocaine use does not dictate a good time. You do. Your body, mind, finances, social life and future will all be destroyed if you keep on this path. You deserve a good life, you deserve to be happy, and you deserve freedom. I have had unsuccessful resuscitation of patients who went into cardiac arrest from use alone, or from patients who had their cocaine cut with fentanyl or other harmful tranquilizers. Every addict thinks-its not going to happen to them. That they're the exception. Please take care of yourself, there's a good world out there. It deserves you in it.",

It's something that my husband is struggling with right now after finding out his son is turning 18th is year. He found out that his(husbands) family abandoned his son too.. husband wasn't in the right way to take his son (few years ago before he and I the state was trying to get him to take his son) he was in deep with his addiction at the time. He felt it wouldn't be responsible or fair or safe.. (he's kept in contact with son) and now he's battling his own feelings about his family and the SA that occurred as a kid. trying to process his feelings about his son and what to do.

        "answer": "Hi, there. Fellow coke addict here.\r\n\r\nWhen I first tried to quit coke, after a few years of heavy abuse, I managed to get three months clean, and when I was feeling better I started yoga. I felt so good and so happy about it! Guess what? I relapsed hard. Got a few more months clean, was feeling so happy, relapsed.\r\n\r\nWhen I finally decided to get help, one of the first things I learned in therapy is that an addict\u2019s comfort zone is down the hole. Our minds tricks us into not accepting happiness, like if we don\u2019t deserve it. It\u2019s a mix of guilty and fear and self-sabotage. So you have tools in therapy to reset this behavior and go back to \u201cnormal\u201d.\r\n\r\nTo me it was a long process of learning to love myself, to love and cherish my life, my family, my friends, my work, my clients\u2026 I used coke as an escape from some really bad depression and self-destructive behaviors I had long before cocaine entered my life\u2026 I sabotaged myself in other ways, with over drinking, always feeling defensive and criticized, always angry and jealous, having meaningless one-night stands with strangers\u2026 When I tried coke it made me feel awesome and sexy and dangerous and edgy\u2026 Wow, it was the recipe for disaster and I was instantly hooked.\r\n\r\nFast-forward to rock bottom loosing a job and almost dying, I go to therapy and learn all this awful things about myself I wasn\u2019t aware before.   \r\n\r\nMy point is: if you really want to quit, get some professional help. A good therapist can help you discover your triggers, your motives and how to break this pattern.\r\n\r\nMy tools have been routine, creating good new habits, getting close to nature and sunlight, and gratitude. Be grateful. Take a look around, pay attention to all this good moments and people you say you missed, and tell yourself you deserve it. You deserve this happiness, you deserve your job, you deserve this guy you like, you deserve your your family and friends. Convince yourself how important you are to them, and how they want you to be there, and you will be your best self to be there for them and to cherish this moments.\r\n\r\nRecovery can be painful, therapy can be painful, but it really pays off. Of course life is not perfect and there will be bad days when you feel defeated and tempted to go down the hole again, but there\u2019s a point you can reach when you identify the exact moment you want to self-sabotage and you go for a walk or have an ice-cream instead of stuffing your face in blow.\r\n\r\nUse this moment of venting to take control of your life, you have the right motivation! \r\n\r\nTake care and good luck!",

The sad thing is, I know it\u2019s the very relationship with pornography that has caused me to be lonely, caused me to seek out strangers on anonymous chat forums, caused me to go out less and become antisocial; caused me to become depressed, less motivated, anxious, stressed, dependent on pleasure, empty, calloused, broken, ashamed. \r\n\r\nI feel I can\u2019t produce healthy relationships, friendly or romantic. My focus of romantic relationships become solely based on physical intimacy, not necessarily sexual, but touching and feeling through hugs, holding of hands. I know relationships are much more than that and certainly much deeper on an emotional and spiritual level than physical. \r\n\r\nPornography has warped my view on others, myself, relationships, reality. It has helped me to isolate myself, develop trust issues, become broken and breaking others, distort my thinking, pervert my thoughts; prevented me to succeed and live a healthy, proactive life. \r\n\r\nI hate myself. I hate my lifestyle. After doing something for so long, you\u2019re so used to it, that though you despise it, you can\u2019t seem to break it out of comfort. \r\n\r\nPeople can recognize drug addicts, alcoholics; any sort of addictive behavior. The hardest one to identify is pornography or sexual vices overall. I wish someone can recognize it and say to me, \u201cI know what you\u2019re doing\u201d that way I have no other choice but to get help.",

We can't stop what we are doing, don't know why we do it, keep returning to it for a false sense of comfort or self medication.\r\n\r\nThe bad news is that it never gets better, only worse, UNLESS you reach out and get some help. \r\n\r\nThe good news is there is alot of help out there.\r\n\r\nThe nofap sub here is a great place to start. I also recommend seeing a doctor and explaining how you feel so they can at least steer you to someone who can help with the emotional side of all of this\r\n\r\nI appreciate you feel awful but please take these first steps.

Peter never had a history of any mental problems, Mike has some mild anxiety problems currently in therapy and I am diagnosed with anxiety and panic disorder. We were having a debate today that family/marriage/kids is not happiness for everyone.

Me and Mike were insisting that you need to be happy with yourself first in order to be happy with someone else and Peter was just saying that we both are weak and we need to go and enjoy our life outside this weakness to be able to get rid off any problems.

I've continued to play music and festivals as well. Everything in my life has improved since getting clean and sober. Well.... Almost everything. \r\n\r\nI'm starting to feel the effects of sobriety after the last decade. I feel a lack of relaxation, perspective, and adventure. Sometimes I feel it is more accessible to drink when going out with friends and my wife. Restaurants, festivals, bars, parties and friends ONLY have booze. Water and soda is very rare. I still haven't even had any alcohol.\r\n\r\nI have no urge to return to my drug of choice (opiates and pills in general), but the idea of marijuana as a legal supplement does sound relieving. \r\n\r\nAm I saving my life?

        "answer": "Firstly, congratulations. That's quite an achievement.\r\n\r\nLet's look at things another way. Say that you were to start smoking a little weed, here and there. Giving yourself the permission and taking on the personal responsibility of doing so. Aware of the risks as such, that you may branch out a little bit, here and there - and then maybe - have a few blowouts. That's entirely a reasonable possibility. Who knows really what the consequences of that might be.\r\n\r\nMore than that though, how would/might this impact your relationships? With your wife and children? What's the worst possible outcome that you might face here? What's the best possible outcome you could achieve? And looking at both of them; is the person you want to be?\r\n\r\nIt would be unusual for you not, from time to time, to have intrusive thoughts. If you're tired, from not enough sleep. Or maybe you're not interacting enough in meaningful relationships with people; your environment really plays a massive role here. Well, it can start to play a trick or two on you. You start to have doubts; \"Oh, just once - what harm can it really do?\" \r\n\r\nSometimes you just have to acknowledge that you're not feeling great about life or some aspects of it. And then just say; \"Okay, so I'm feeling / thinking these things. They're just thoughts. I don't need them, so I can let them go.\" And you really can. That's the power you have now; you can make a choice. Sometimes we don't realise how much influence in the outcomes of our lives, and that there is a space for us to make a choice. We can influence our impulses.\r\n\r\nI wish you well. I really do. You made a choice to come and get support. That's shows you have a level of depth and maturity. That you care. Things may still provoke or irritate you, but don't forget that you have come so far already. And you still have a way to go. Just how that turns out, lies at your feet.",

Anyway as the night went on I ended up doing about 5 lines and drunk way more than I thought I was going to. This happened Friday and I still feel anxious as I have a presentation to do tomorrow. How do you guys try go easy on yourself. I\u2019m currently catching up with work and I keep telling myself that I am an absolute idiot for taking it too far and should have controlled myself better.

        "question": "Bare with me please I\u2019m an addict taking that hardest first step. I became an meth addict. I quit Friday morning. I\u2019ve always been a functioning addict but when I lost my live in gf of 5 years, a few weeks later my company sold and my management position was eliminated and I was partnerless and jobless in a big house that requires two earners to afford. My abuse went into over drive. I was using it to cope with what clearly was depression setting in. I played the tough guy and pretended I was doing fine and things were getting better. I moved closer to family and yet continued my self destruction. I\u2019m sure they\u2019ve noticed but I thought I hid it. After a few months I found a good job so I thought. I watched for other opportunities as upper management worked me to the ground. So I continued using on the same pace as I had begun after the breakup. Finally one day before Christmas I sat with my boss and said I can\u2019t keep working into the ground and watch my life balance completely disappear. I wasn\u2019t able to date to see friends and I saw my family less than when I lived in another state. Our separation was ammlicable.  But I continued to use. Haven\u2019t found a job and have done nothing but stew about what came and went in my life this year and how a habit is clearly to blame in a lot of this. I\u2019ve slept much of it off the last two days and I\u2019m not fuzzy mentally at the moment. But the emotional havoc my mind is having when I think to the past and all that I\u2019ve lost and all that\u2019s been removed from my life that I held so dearly because of my selfishness and my addiction just makes me sick. I know right now I need to focus on what my future can bring by being sober and never touching this dream killer again and later come to terms with the past but damn it\u2019s hard. I don\u2019t wanna touch the stuff or see the stuff ever again and I\u2019ll never forgive myself for what I let do to me. But how can I begin to to see what good will come for saying I\u2019m done no more I will not let this drug suck me in? There is a lyric from a song that I keep sticking to give me strength.  \u201cThe change begins with one step. However small the first step is hardest of all. But when I get my gait I\u2019ll be walking tall\u201d I know I can get my life back. Thank you for reading.",

It\u2019s a difficult decision to stick to, but the good thing is, with meth the wd\u2019s aren\u2019t physical, you might get some stomach cramps and be excessively tired and hungry, I\u2019ve quit many times and the only positive thing I could tell myself some days was \u201cthank god I\u2019m not wd from heroin\u201d.  and also it helps to remember that there\u2019s no way in hell reintroducing meth into your life will improve your lifestyle.",

My partner is an endurance athlete and has been increasing his training intensity, frequency, etc. It\u2019s happened a handful of times now where, around meal time, he\u2019ll reference how many calories he burned per his app or whatever he uses to program his workouts.

I know the title is weird, but I\u2019m not doing well lately and would appreciate some advice. I keep getting into these sort of vicious cycles where I put things off until they get out of control, and then I\u2019m too embarrassed to go out and do anything about it. Right now my hair is just completely wild and out of control, it looks horrible and ridiculous but I\u2019m so embarrassed that I can\u2019t get myself to go to a barber. I also was doing better for a while taking Celexa and Vistaril I got prescribed after being in a hospital, but I was having a hard time finding a psych and therapist of my own. I felt like I was doing OK when I first ran out of meds but since things got worse again I can\u2019t bring myself to go find anyone to get help. I think they\u2019ll just realize I\u2019m such an idiot that I\u2019m not worth their effort/deserving of meds. If anyone has any tips on getting myself psyched up or whatever to go do this stuff I\u2019d really appreciate it.",
        "answer": "Okay, as a preface I apologize if I come off as, for a better term, structured but here is what I recommend: \r\n1) for the hair, put on a hat. If you don\u2019t feel like going to the barber rn and then don\u2019t. It\u2019s good to expose yourself to uncomfortable situations but you\u2019re too uncomfortable don\u2019t push yourself. I get a depression beard cuz it\u2019s just too much and that\u2019s okay. You\u2019re appearance should be for you first and foremost. \r\n2) for the therapist, check your insurance and see who is in network. Also see if you have any drug clinics in your area who do mental health; in my area a lot of them do, and in fact my councilor is out of a rehab center and they are great. \r\n3) once you find a therapist, see if they\u2019re willing to do telehealth. Since the pandemic providers are now more open to that and your ins should tell you also if they do it as well. Helps to have therapy in a place that makes you comfortable. \r\n4) don\u2019t fuck with your medications. If you were running out contact the hospital who prescribed them to see what they can recommend or do. As you experienced a sudden stop of those will make things a lot worse for you; conversely, taking too much isn\u2019t good either as, at least in my case, some meds can also be muscle relaxers and really mess with you. \r\n5) the doctors and therapists are paid by you to help you. It is their job. They went to school to help people. Let them help you. It will hurt, you may feel like it\u2019s bs or it\u2019s not for you but you have to stick with it, even though it hurts.\r\nAnd finally:\r\n6) do not stop talking. This is something that I\u2019ve grown to accept I need to do-keeping what your feeling is not healthy, and I\u2019m sure you have friends and family to help. If you don\u2019t, you reached out for help here which shows you want to get better so keep talking, work through it, and keep going.",

        "question": "What's a reasonable boundary to set re. my friend's cocaine use? I'm not an expert, but from what I can tell, my friend is a drug addict. Primarily he uses cocaine but he has experimented with harder substances. He has good times and bad times, where he uses more (like multiple times a week) and reacts worse.\r\n\r\nDuring the bad times he is incredibly difficult to deal with, and he can be very mean. After a very bad recent episode I threatened to end our friendship over his out-of-control drug use for my own mental health, and he told me he would get clean. AFAIK he was clean for a few months, then he took cocaine again. He told me that his therapist has agreed that it's fine to do cocaine occasionally, as long as he doesn't do anything harder.\r\n\r\nMy question is: how often is actually reasonable? I understand that some people can do it occasionally without developing a critical issue, but I don't feel super confident in my friend's ability to self-regulate. As such, I want to set a clear boundary about how much cocaine use I can tolerate from him, something along the lines of \"if you do cocaine more frequently than X amount of times per X unit of time measurement then I'll have to re-evaluate our friendship.\" Is once per month reasonable? I'd feel more comfortable with maybe once every two or three months, but is that too restrictive? Or am I going about this totally wrong? I want to set a boundary, yes, but I also want it to be a limit that he can reasonably adhere to.\r\n\r\nSorry for the essay. Grateful for any advice.",
        "answer": "Giving anyone an ultimatum, even though you are well meaning and only doing so out of love, will only backfire on you. I don\u2019t have a good answer for you, I\u2019m not sure there is one. Actually, any time his drug abuse affects you is unacceptable and it\u2019s okay to let them know that.

Okay backstory is my husband (been together nearly 7 years) is 26, was heavily addicted to pills from a very young age about 19, so maybe age 13/14 til 19. \r\nHe has a a few relapses that I caught since then, but to my knowledge nothing really in at least 3-4 years. He just uses thc pens regularly now. \r\n\r\nToday I got all 4 of my wisdom teeth removed and was prescribed 8 hydrocodone with i think acetaminophen. It\u2019s listed as Norco, which I know he\u2019s taken on occasion in the past.\r\nSo he was already asleep and I went to take one before bed as my pain was getting worse, I dumped them to count them and there are only 6. I have not taken a single one yet. My ibuprofen and antibiotic are fine but not norco is missing 2. \r\nI also struggle with the fact a that his addiction is with him probably forever because he to this day has not gotten professional help or ever been to therapy like he has promised me so many times over at least the last 2 years. \r\nI\u2019m frustrated and I\u2019m hurt. \r\n\r\nI need to ask him but I don\u2019t know what to do or how to do it. I understand to certain extents the way he hides and lies with slip ups, and it\u2019s nearly ended or relationship at least once.  I guess I am asking here because I do not know where to turn and I am hoping someone from his shoes might be able to give me any advice.",
        "answer": "First off, so sorry you\u2019re going through this. IRD incredibly painful to watch the ones we love do things that hurt us and themselves. \r\n\r\nA few thoughts I have\u2026 \r\n\r\n1. An addict has an addiction that stays with them forever regardless of if they get professional help or not. Professional help (therapist, 12 steps, SMART recovery, treatment program, sponsor, support network, etc) is to develop tools and new coping mechanisms with an aim to increase the likelihood of staying sober. The addiction will always be in the background, that\u2019s why guys with 20 years sober still say they got there \u201cone day at a time\u201d. \r\n\r\n2. Don\u2019t ask him, because he might deny it and that will make you crazy. Always trust your gut. Tell him you know and do not need to argue or prove you know. Do not give in or give room to negotiate what you know happened. Walk away if you have to and go silent and wait. \r\n\r\n3. Set boundaries, and make sure you are prepared to follow through. Anger or hurt feelings without boundaries does not inspire changed behavior. Boundaries without follow through erase your credibility. Consider things like \u201cI will not be in a relationship with an addict who is not pursuing recovery and following all treatment recommendations\u201d. Or \u201cgoing forward all narcotic medication will be going on a safe only I have the combination to\u201d.\r\n\r\n4. If he won\u2019t get help, you can for you, therapy, and alanon /naranon, etc are available for you to help you navigate. \r\n\r\nBest of luck OP.",

We rarely talk, and he started telling me these things very early on. \r\n\r\nI have called the emergency hotline him and I even made direct contact with his mom about my concern about him. \r\n\r\nBut the thing is, I talk about it to my friends, and think it\u2019s a huge burden for me to carry, and that I shouldn\u2019t be the one responsible for getting him all this help and support. \r\n\r\nTonight, my friends said that it is none of my business to tell other people that he\u2019s suicidal, and they think it\u2019s rude for me to tell them his business. I say that I\u2019m near a stranger to him, and that it shouldn\u2019t be my responsibility to save his life, and they say that I\u2019m no stranger, I\u2019m his roommate. Meanwhile, I was just randomly selected by the university to live with him for a school year. Just because I\u2019m his roommate doesn\u2019t mean I necessarily know him or have a bond with him. \r\n\r\nSometimes I bring friends over to our dorm to stop by, and he tells them, people he\u2019s never met before, that he\u2019s suicidal and things along those lines. Those people are complete strangers to him, and I don\u2019t think they should have to bare responsibility for him either. I think it\u2019s something highly inappropriate to be telling us, because we are no therapists or other mental health professional.\r\n\r\nI think we are justified in telling other people because this is a huge thing to be telling a practical stranger, and we need to release our stresses in life, but my friends were saying he\u2019s coming to me because \u201che feels security with me and trusts me\u201d. But I feel this isn\u2019t the case because I barely know him, and he tells my friends that\u2019s just shortly stop by at our dorm. I shouldn\u2019t be the person to determine whether he live or die. \r\n\r\nMy friends tell me that my perspective is likely distorted because of my sister, whom is bipolar and severely mentally ill and suicidal. I say that doesn\u2019t have much to do with it, he should not be telling me and my friends about this stuff, and if he does, we are free to feel uncomfortable with it. \r\n\r\nThe thing that annoys me the most is that they don\u2019t live with him, so they don\u2019t understand the situation. They think I\u2019m in the wrong solely because his is suicidal, but I don\u2019t think I am because it\u2019s a huge burden to put on someone to tell them these things, especially if you barely know them, and that I have full right to tell other people what he is saying to me because it makes me uncomfortable. It honestly seems like a bit of a threat to me because now I don\u2019t feel comfortable bringing friends over. \r\n\r\nThe thing is, I am no mental health professional, I am a 19 year old college student trying to get a degree, I obviously have enough stresses, with him, he has added to these stresses and I have called people (emergency hotline and his mom) to help him. But somehow my friends think I\u2019m doing bad by telling other people my issues about feeling uncomfortable about it all. They think I should do more for him, but I feel as though I shouldn\u2019t have that responsibility.",

I am a long time anxiety and depression sufferer, I am nearing the end of my 20\u2019s and recently I\u2019ve started having panic attacks where I am convinced that I\u2019m going to die, or that something is wrong and I need to go to the hospital. The strange thing is that my mood as of recently seems to have changed drastically. I have a strange and altered sense of reality, or, alternatively, a new fear of my own existence. I am quite literally having panic attacks because I am alive and afraid of dying. This is not something I was struggling with at all in the last several years, and up until a few days ago my anxiety was very tame. Then, yesterday, I wasn\u2019t feeling well at work, and suddenly my brain became overwhelmed with negative thoughts. I started thinking about how I don\u2019t imagine my own future, how I have no hope things will ever get better, they spiraled so far I convinced myself I was dying and that somehow internally I knew this and started freaking out. I still don\u2019t understand why it happened. I struggle with depression but theses thoughts were unusually dark and held more weight for some reason. I\u2019m not sure what to do now, I can\u2019t shake this fear of dying and living.",

        "question": "Wedding dress woes Hi friends. I'm just looking for support/tips if you've been in a similar situation. I am very lucky that my best friend and the love of my life has asked me to marry them. I've recently tentatively started looking at dresses online to see what style I might like but it's turned into a triggering nightmare due to the measurements and sizes. I'm in recovery and doing well generally but just can't imagine looking as beautiful as the models in these dresses at the size I am now. Really hate this disease for ruining what should be a joyful experience for me \ud83d\ude22",
        "answer": "When I was dress shopping for my wedding, I focused more on looking for something that fit my style. I knew dress shopping in person was going to be bad for me, I'd had horrible experiences with prom dress shopping and bridesmaid dress shopping for friends' weddings. I did not want to repeat that. (But that's me). So my mom and I shopped online for a style I loved, then had the dress I fell in love with made to my measurements. (I had her take them and send them in, so I never saw them). And I *loved* the way I looked in that dress. I felt amazing in it, even though I didn't look anything like the model. \r\n\r\nIf in store shopping would be less triggering for you, I'd suggest skipping online shopping and setting up an appointment with a place where you can tell them your style and they pick out dresses for you to try.\r\n\r\nOh, and be aware, for some awful reason, wedding dress sizes run small. So keep that in mind if they mention sizes! You are *not* bigger than you think. You have *not* suddenly gained a bunch of weight. The industry is just mean about sizing.",

Heroin in the past, opioids and benzos etc. He is currently getting monthly buvidal (Buprenorphine) injections at his doctor.. I have been trying to support him as much as I can. We have been through a lot and I adore him. He isn't a bad human, he's a hard working beautiful human that's struggling. \r\nLast night I took a drink from a water bottle in my car, that he had bought that day - it tasted like chemicals and I felt strange after.

        "question": "Weed is destroying my life  I\u2019m a 17 year old kid struggling with life. I started smoking weed at 15 years old out of pure curiosity. Let\u2019s just say that \u201ccuriosity\u201d turned into something more. I couldn\u2019t get enough of this stuff. A \u201cSaturday night only\u201d thing turned into a weekend thing. Then, It turned into me smoking on school nights. From there, it\u2019s just gotten out of hand. Since 15, I\u2019ve taken 3 T breaks. That\u2019s it. With all this being said, I\u2019ve gotten myself stuck. Weed has ruined me. I used to be this fun, energetic kid filled with life and happiness. (It\u2019s kinda funny, I would always say to myself before all of this  \u201cwhy do people get sad? Just be happy\u201d). I found myself stoner friends that just encourage my weed addiction and vaping. I barely have any motivation anymore and the \u201canxiety of life,\u201d as they call it, is really getting to me. I\u2019m not happy with the person I\u2019ve become. Im scared for who I might become. I feel sluggish, brain dead, and unmotivated all the time. Weed has become me. And I feel if I keep staying on this road, it\u2019ll end me. Does anyone have any suggestions for quitting?",
        "answer": "That's tough, but the good news is that you're aware of it and looking for help. One suggestion I've heard from people who've successfully quit or reduced their weed use is finding alternative ways to manage stress and anxiety, whether that's through exercise, therapy, meditation, or anything else that works for you.\r  \r\n\r  \r\nAnother thing to consider is reaching out to a support group, like a 12-step program specifically for people trying to quit or reduce their weed consumption. They can provide a community of other people who are going through the same thing and offer accountability and support as you navigate this process.\r  \r\n\r  \r\nFinally, it might be worth trying some CBD products like [https://blondebud.com/product/cbd-cbg-tincture/](https://blondebud.com/product/cbd-cbg-tincture/) as a way to manage symptoms of anxiety or stress without the negative side effects of THC. CBD products won't make you feel high, but they might help you feel calmer and more relaxed.",

But my mother kept pushing and pushing that \"I can't just rely on meds forever\" and that \"I'm fine now so I don't need them anymore\". So I started feeling ashamed of the fact I needed them even though I perfectly knew it's normal and in my best interest to take them (I worked through my toxic relationship with my mother on therapy, so I know now why I caved in)) But I did quit eventually, I started believing it was a good decision and consulted my psychiatrist. There's been ups and lows, I signed up for therapy but I've been feeling like crap since November. Again, there's been ups and lows but at this point it's just unbearable. Idk if it's because I just need to work it through therapy or if I actually need my meds back to feel better. \r\n\r\nI've been feeling rather anxious and hopeless. There are rarely any moments when I actually feel good for a prolonged period of time.

Before that, he was doing coke and ketamine quite often. Daily at some point. Eventually he opened up and told me he was struggling with addiction. It made me sad and I wanted to help. Fast forward to once we actually started dating. He claims he has been sober the entire time aside from two slip ups. One in august. One last weekend. I do not believe this at all and what makes it worse is that he becomes extremely defensive and angry when I tell him that. The reason I don\u2019t believe it is that for the entirety of our relationship, he is ALWAYS broke. No matter how much he works. For some background, I\u2019m the bread winner in our relationship and I pay all of the bills. He doesn\u2019t have to pay a thing. So for him to always be broke is very suspicious. His money basically disappears. Also, there are so many times where he\u2019ll be up all hours of the night into the early morning with the sniffles and ends up falling asleep with tissue in his nose. This is what led me to finding out he was doing coke last week. I looked around the room and within a minute of searching, found a coke straw in his empty cigarette box. Anyway, I do not believe that this was only one of two times he has slipped up since we got together. I\u2019ve just never really tried to bring it up even if I noticed signs. But I\u2019m getting upset about being lied to and I just want him to feel comfortable enough to be honest. What can I do?",
        "answer": "There is so much shame around addiction, it's difficult for him to be honest.  He's probably struggling with that. The only thing that would help him is unconditional love, that he feels secure that he won't be rejected for having this addiction. As long as he hides, he won't take responsability for his addiction. I say that as an addict in recovery that used to hide from my wife.   \r\nIf he can go beyond the shame, he may be able to look for help, therapy or support group, that's the only way out. You can show him the way by joining yourself an al-anon support groups, it's hard to deal on your own with an addicted partner. Have a look at /r/naranon/ too.",

The sooner you get off it the better in my opinion. What I've learnt at 41 after six years of sobriety \ud83c\udf89 is that habit, is the main driving force in most addictions and is able to be changed by acknowledgement and planning. Change what you do after work. I started by making my bed in the morning and when I did it I told myself this was a day of change, I didn't have to do anything more that day but with potential to do more. soon I was doing it more and more often. And then in those days I could try other things like doing press ups or making my lunch. Habits can be changed with courage and pesistance. Tackling booze and having AFD's alcohol free days is a great goal but first get used to being able to see your behavioural patterns and effect them with change.\r\nGive yourself time, being aware of your behaviour and then being able to effect it takes time and you need to find your own motivation to want to affect it.

        "answer": "I think you will find quite a lot of people use drugs , especially uppers ie : coke, crack, amphetamines, meth etc.\r\nTaking drugs and masturbating or sex with prostitutes and people is quite a normal combination.\r\n\r\nTalking about it is going to make you realise it\u2019s not as big as you think . People have porn addiction , masturbating, sex addiction and so on.\r\n\r\nI also had the panic attacks during using drugs and it is drug psychosis, again which is common in taking \u201cuppers\u201d. \r\nThe main thing is you have spoken now , the next step is to speak to people in person.\r\nYou are aware of your situation and if you address it now you can get a grip of this.\r\n\r\nYou will have to get to the bottom of the why\u2019s to how and where the underlying issues started .\r\n\r\nThere is no reason to panic and feel like you are any worse than any other person that\u2019s been stuck in a situation with drugs\u2026 there\u2019s always an answer and a way out.",

I have cravings all day and I just try to ignore them, occupy myself with duties or friends, or read the AA book. For now I don't have therapy or any professional help but I do have a friend who might as well he my sponsor, however I can't handle bringing this subject to her attention anymore. It breaks her heart. \r\n\r\nWhat more can or should I do? For basic info, I'm 22 ftm, ADHD, BPD AND OCD, my triggers are basically being around weed/alcohol, being alone or bored, or being heart broken. Which happens a lot. My goal is to stop completely for 2 years than evaluate my life. Being sober isnt boring, but it is very hard to deal with bad times. I want to get better, but I'm struck in a spiral rn.",
        "answer": "This might sound bizarre but it worked for me often. I have the same thing, I know when I've got that itch and it felt inevitable (it isnt). I started trying to remove the emotion aspect to it and view it simply in terms of my brain and habit. Your brain has created neural networks that lead you to use whatever substance or activity. You have feelings of sadness, you use, feeling of happiness, you use, until eventually your brain feels hardwired to always use. But it isn't. When you get those urges, try not to panic or get angry or shamed or anything, try viewing it as a signal being shot through your head. The more you use, the more often you'll get those signals. If you view them in that sense I found I had way more power to ignore. And first I'd give myself 10 minutes to ignore, and by then the signals had passed and I didn't want to anymore. the more you can do that, the stronger you make the neural pathway of \"craving --> stay sober\" . And it builds on itself until your brain redirects more and more easily. At first there will probably be times that you will still follow through with using because it's so habitual at that point, but you can see it as a brain malfunction and not shame yourself \r\n\r\n\r\nAnd I'm not saying you aren't hurting, and that it's simply a bad habit. There are reasons we get to that point, but it's a hell of a lot easier to deal with them when you aren't stuck in the cycle of fucking over your brain and body",

        "question": "I only truly feel my emotions when intoxicated It's 2pm and I am drunker than I thought before trying to type, bare with me I'm not certain much of this will make a lot of sense.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSober I don't cry, I don't get angry... but when I lose control of myself it's like everything I've been holding in just comes pouring out. I can only cry when I'm too drunk to remember most of it, and the parts I do remember, I know it's a vicious cry - soaking face and clothes in my tears and snot kind of cry. But when I'm sober it feels like my emotions just keep boiling up inside me but never boil over. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPart if what keeps me attached to the alcohol is the ability to just get it out. To cry. To drunk text people the thoughts that have been eating me. I'm glad my drink of choice makes me Sappy because a lot of my drunk texts are just telling my friends how much I love them and how much I cherish their friendships. Stuff I can't bring myself to say sober. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBut then I carry the disgust of myself for repeating the habits of my parents who ruined my life. Alcoholic parents. Alcoholic son. Repeating history. The only difference between me and them is what I drink and the fact I don't hurt any kids because I don't have any. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOk so the main difference is that I get lovey when I'm like this and they left me with the need for lifelong therapy but I just hate that I feel like them. I hate that I cant even be mad about what they did because I *get* it. I know that tug and pull of looking at your bank account and all logic going out the window. I know the justifications you make to rationalize choosing booze over food. Im just lucky that i dont have kids.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI spent the rest of my money for the month on Alcohol because I just couldn't stand feeling empty anymore. I wanted to be angry, to be lovey, to cry... to feel something other than plain-ness. To have the courage to remind my friends that I love them. To not feel scared of letting the pain come out instead of it sitting inside me. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI just wish I could feel this sober. I can't handle how it feels to exist sober. I don't know if I want to try anymore. I was so determined. Going to NA. I have a counselor. I'm in the programs. I was doing the work. But I'm still using, still drinking because it's just far too much to survive without it. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMy head is a dark place that brews and brews until I find some kind of aid that helps the pot boil over and I don't know how to survive without the crutch.",
        "answer": "First of all, I\u2019m so sorry you\u2019re feeling this way. It sounds really painful and I relate to so much of it. \r\n\r\nI\u2019ve got 14 months clean and sober now and it\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve gotten past 90 days. I had almost exactly the same problem\u2026 I couldn\u2019t cry while sober and it felt so frustrating. I couldn\u2019t be lovey or show affection unless I had some drinks in me. I couldn\u2019t even thank someone or give a compliment. Definitely issues that stemmed back to a parent\u2019s alcoholism and irrational, erratic behavior. \r\n\r\nIt took me 6 months of being clean to actually be able to cry. But then, I swear, I started crying at almost anything\u2026 happy things, sad things, just feeling empathy for another person. I started being able to show people in my life that I was thankful for them. It was difficult but I felt like I needed to do it because I\u2019d always wanted to be able to show those people that I was grateful. \r\n\r\nI know it\u2019s excruciating, trust me, I do. But, somewhere along the way, you learned you weren\u2019t allowed to cry and now the only way you can is by ingesting a substance that takes down all your defenses \u2026but it\u2019s also ruining your life. If you stay off of it for long enough, you\u2019ll learn how to feel all those things naturally. It\u2019ll definitely feel awkward, but it\u2019ll be worth it to feel whole again without something that\u2019s leeching your finances, mental health, and relationships. \r\n\r\nAnd I don\u2019t know if this helps, but I don\u2019t really do 12-step. It didn\u2019t really work for me. I use a lot of principles from it and I may go again one day, but it\u2019s not how I got clean or got through my first year. \r\n\r\nGo check into a good rehab program and then find a good IOP program to do for a few months after that. (The rehab will definitely help you with that aftercare plan.) The friends I made in that program have been a really solid support for me these last 14 months. They say connection is the opposite of addiction, and i whole heartedly subscribe to that. \r\n\r\nI hope things get better for you. :)",

DBT \"TIPS\" skill have helped me a lot. most importantly, shame will not serve you moving forward, try to be kind to yourself and compassionately acknowledge your discomfort and pain. talk to other addicts and know you're not alone, and there is a way out. highly recommend SMART Recovery (CBT based) and Refuge Recovery (Buddhism based) for process addictions.

        "question": "I have a drug problem I\u2019m not really sure why I decided to come in here, but I feel like I really have no other place to go. I am 22M studying finance/marketing in college. I was adopted when I was a baby and my parents are quite successful. My mother owns a company and my father comes from a very successful European family. They both attended prestigious schools and expect nothing less from me or my older sister. My older sister is a former  5-star athlete and amazing student who has started her own company and is doing masters program in Europe. My grandfather invented a pretty famous product and my father inherited the patent when he was 14 because my grandfather passed away. My father never had a good relationship with his family, aside from his mother. My grandmother was the most amazing person in the world, but that\u2019s a different story. My mother comes from a successful Midwest family and has 8 siblings and our extended family is around 200 people. I am the youngest member of my family and needless to say I have a lot of eyes and pressure on me to be successful. I decided to go straight to college after hs but never really went to class, partied a lot and basically got myself kicked out. My parents were so mad and I ended up moving out of their house, living on my own and working full time first the first time to pay for all of my own stuff. I grew up a privileged childhood and I know I have taken so much for granted and this has put a tremendous strain on my relationships with my family. Growing up my parents never really said no except when it came to drugs and partying. I was never allowed to go to parties until late in hs and I was drug tested throughout hs. This didn\u2019t really stop me too much and I was in trouble a lot junior year. The only thing that was rally stopping me was that I was playimg on a high level soccer team and was being recruited to play at some smaller school. Unfortunately I got hit with a bunch of injuries and that halted my plans for college soccer. When I finally went to school I played for fin but definitely focused on just having. Fun. During the year that I left school, I started smoking weed and drinking a lot. I was working a construction/sales job and was making pretty decent money considering my situation. As the money started rolling in I started getting into cocaine. I was able to hide a lot of my stuff from my parents but I started selling carts and weed and my parents saw my bank transactions and called me out. They told me if I stop and get my shit together and do some online classes they would pay for me to go back to school. So I chilled out a bit and kept my head down and went back to school. That was 3 years ago. I have always had a big social circle and that has been by design. Do this day I\u2019m still not sure what is actually wrong with me, maybe I\u2019m a psychopath or just insanely arrogant but I have a reason for absolutely everthing I do. I make sure to plan my interactions, I choose words and leave out details in order to get stuff out of people. And it works. I don\u2019t know why or how, but I grew up in a upper middle class white family and even though I am brown, I have somehow been granted some version of classism/privilege. My sister is really the only one I talk to about this but she made the note that I one across as always laid back even when the world is burning. We\u2019ll in order to stop me from losing my mind, i have started really just self medicating. I have so many issues with my body, mostly from sports and working construction, but now I know it\u2019s other things too. About 2 years ago I decided I wanted to work out and get back into shape. I started lifting like 10 times a week going 2x a day and just non stop work. I ended up hopping on sarms and it allowed me to push my body to new limits. I\u2019m the end I got hurt because I would use the sarms to numb my body and I would smoke and take preworkout to  push though the pain. I was doing an summer internship at an investment firm and so my and the other interns were always doing adderal, Ritalin, or something to keep us focused. I then started getting back into coke after meeting a mutual friend at a party that deals. We ended up striking up a deal and I could get him into parties and he could sell. After the first few parties I brought him to I got a different kind of high. The high of having power. I can get into that later but basically fast forward to when school starts and me and my friends are buying 8bas every weekend doing a g and then selling the rest at parties. I started moving so much product for my guy that he was giving me free stuff just cuz he knew I would move it. Around this time I started getting into shrooms. I used them as an escape/reset when I was in a bad mental place or just had a lot going on. I have had some amazing experiences and some truly horrifying experiences (i can share) but I started microdosing a lot and would mix it with weed and cocaine. I started getting some crazy trips which led me to Molly, popper, concerta to name a few. I still don\u2019t want to get into anything stronger and acid scares the shit out of me. But basically I am at the point in my life where I am unable to sleep unless I am on something. I hate being with my own thoughts and I have started disassociated from certain things. I almost feel like I can\u2019t distinguish what is real and what is me being high or just overthinking. I cannot tell my family for a variety of reasons. Of course it would kill them and it would mess everthing up. But the other reason is because I have never been doing better from the outside looking in. I am currently in the last rounds of interviews for some big private equity and wealth management firms. I am still dealing and making good money, I live in a party house which has only made me more popular and crave the attention more. But at the same time I feel like I\u2019m stuck in a time loop. Every week is the same. I constantly relive memories. I don\u2019t remember doing school work and yet I am doing good in my classes. I just find time to grind stuff out and I basically just live for the weekend. The reason I\u2019m writing this is because I know that I am so close to losing it. I am currently in love with my best friend and I don\u2019t know how to tell her, I know if I keep doing this amount of drugs I will die, I know that I can\u2019t keep putting on fake smiles and pretending to like people. I have always been able to smile and be nice to people but recently I have felt myself become really mad or annoyed at absolutely nothing. But I have so many people telling me how good I\u2019m doing and how proud they are of me going back to school and landing a good internship. So  im not sure if anyone will actually see this or spend the time reading it, but I\u2019m open to anything. And I have lowkey lived a pretty crazy life and have a bunch of stories I can share.",

I\u2019ve known him since I was 14 (I\u2019m 23 now, we started dating when I turned 21) and he\u2019s always been one of those kids who smoked weed all the time then eventually that turned into taking percocets & xanax. He got in a long-term relationship and had 2 beautiful kids and stopped taking them. Around the time we started dating COVID had hit and he lost his job and he started taking them again. At first I didn\u2019t know, I thought he was just a really sleepy guy (lol). I never knew the signs. At some point we broke up, no contact at all. I found out from a mutual friend that he overdosed and went to rehab. We got back together shortly after. He ended up doing a 4 month jail stint, related to his drug use, in October and when we would talk on the phone it was the most coherent i\u2019ve ever heard him. Everyone was so proud of him and kept reminding him to keep up the good work when he got home. He even converted to Islam which I know to be a peaceful and disciplined religion. He got released on Jan 29th and I just found out a few days ago that he\u2019s been taking xanax again almost every day for the past week. I don\u2019t know what to do, I\u2019ve never experienced this first-hand. I feel like I have to babysit him to make sure he doesn\u2019t take anymore and OD. He\u2019s on 3 year probation and facing 10 years if he violates. I reminded him that even though he hasn\u2019t started getting drug tested yet it could happen any time then he\u2019s going to feds. He says he\u2019s ashamed, he couldn\u2019t fight the temptation. I love him but I can\u2019t stop my life to babysit him. I know he has to want it for himself but I begged & pleaded with him to stop and he said he would. Sometimes I wish I never even found out, I wish he hid it better and I could be blissfully unaware of it. I\u2019ve never been in this situation before but I\u2019ve asked him if he\u2019d go to NA or therapy and he said no. What will it take for him to stop? I thought he already hit his bottom. I know addiction is a long road and recovery even more so but how do I help him? What am I supposed to do?",

        "question": "Dating an Addict - How do I help? My boyfriend (30m) has been using a variety of drugs since his early teens, and has been to AA/NA & rehab before we started dating a year and a half ago. His primary drug of choice is coke & alcohol, and his come downs are awful. His mood swings are all over the place, and when he gets angry it\u2019s explosive. He\u2019s definitely paranoid. His energy when he\u2019s not using is pretty much non-existent. He\u2019ll go days without showering bc he\u2019s so tired, and can\u2019t be counted on for any apartment responsibilities. He just \u201cdoesn\u2019t care\u201d about almost anything. If he\u2019s not working he has no motivation for anything except partying.\r\n\r\nFrom what I know, and have seen, he uses at least weekly. And when he gets going it\u2019s never a bump or two, it\u2019s a full bottle of whiskey and as much coke as he can handle. When he\u2019s not doing coke he will drink an entire bottle just to fall asleep.\r\n\r\nI will partake sometimes but mostly I smoke weed and drink on the weekends. I\u2019ve told him I\u2019d quite everything if that would help. We\u2019ve talked about him taking a break but when it comes down to it, he\u2019s barely slowing down. Much more than when we started dating but it\u2019s still pretty constant. He tries to compare his coke use to my daily marijuana use, and \r\nknow drug use is drug use, but to me a hit mid workday or before bed is just different from him staying up for 24+ hours and then sleeping for 13 hours to recover. I\u2019m worried about it. I\u2019m worried about what this is doing to his body and his mind. It\u2019s not sustainable.\r\n\r\nI just don\u2019t know where to start. He usually throws my weeds use in my face and cuts off the conversation. If anyone has been in his position before what should I stop doing? What would have been helpful?",
        "answer": "You can support him when he decides to take Recovery seriously, that's about it.\r\n\r\nYou can't make him quit or make him want to be sober, it's entirely on him to do that. The best you can do is set healthy boundaries. \r\n\r\nFor example, if I had a night of drinking I wasn't allowed to handle my son for bath time. It wasn't a punishment or anything, just a boundary my wife set for our families safety. But then I had to make the choice to drink and not spend time with my son.\r\n\r\nLook up support groups for friends and families of addicts. I like SMART Recovery, personally. I hate to say it, but it is likely your BF will get worse before he gets better. You can't rely on hope that he'll spontaneously want to get sober and your relationship will improve. That is generally not how these situations turn out... You have to take care of yourself, you can't be a parent to a full grown man who is an addict.\r\n\r\nGood luck",

Recently she's been having moments of feeling terrible about the way she looks, usually preceded by a large dinner or meal, and occasionally will feel the need to purge. I know I shouldn't be an enabler but it doesn't happen daily or even weekly that I know of. But I'm worried about what I don't know or how to support her or what I can do to help. I don't have experience dating someone with an eating disorder and I feel clueless and helpless. Thank you for taking the time to help if you can.",
        "answer": "I\u2019m really sorry that this is happening. Is she open with you about her struggles with binging and purging? If she is, it might be good to try to talk to her (without being too pushy) about looking into therapy and/or medication. Prozac has changed my life recovering from my eating disorder, as my  emotions are generally a lot more regulated as opposed to skyrocketing between highs and lows, so I don\u2019t feel the urge to binge or purge like I used to.\r\n\r\nI used to think people were lying when they said EDs weren\u2019t about weight, but it\u2019s true. Whenever I traced back my ED episodes, it often began with stress from schools or sadness about other things, then I\u2019d start thinking about my weight and proceed to try to take control (and weirdly, get a dopamine hit) off binging and purging. I would try to be there for her, talk with her, distract her, whatever she wants to do when she\u2019s feeling those emotional lows- hopefully getting her mind far away enough from feeling an urge to binge and purge. But ultimately, no one can or should be held responsible for every second of someone\u2019s life, so know that it is not your fault if/when these episodes happen anyways.\r\n\r\nSort of a side note but I would avoid making comments about her body for the most part. Even well intended comments about looking healthy can send someone with an ED into a spiral (associating healthy with gaining weight, then feeling a need to compensate). And comments about looking slim can make people with EDs feel excited and make them think they should keep up what they are doing.\r\n\r\nI hope your girlfriend is willing to talk open up about these issues to you, and if she is, you should ask her what you can do to help her with this and encourage her to seek treatment again if need be. I\u2019m glad you\u2019re trying to help her, and I hope that you are easy on yourself as EDs are incredibly difficult to understand, and ultimately, you cannot make someone break those habits; they have to choose to.",

Psychology.com and zodoc have similar searches but you'd have to manually select your insurance and it's not as perfect as the insurance websites.

So yeah, being broke, and not being able to go back to rehab, staying with them was really my only and best option. \r\n\r\nI\u2019ve been here a month, well a month tomorrow, and at first things were going great. I was able to stay clean for 4-5 days. Even though my mom and I have had a rough relationship through out most of my life she has been extremely supportive and understanding. Overall, my environment here with my family has been good, probably the best it\u2019s ever been since I was way younger. \r\n\r\nHowever, I started using again within the first week of being here, and I haven\u2019t told anyone in my family about it because I don\u2019t want to keep hurting them. I also am extremely grateful for everything they\u2019re doing for me right now, and I\u2019m just taking advantage of them by continuing to use when I\u2019m supposed to be getting sober. I don\u2019t even really understand why I keep choosing to do it. \r\n\r\nI\u2019ve only admitted this to my ex, who is still a really good friend of mine, but the constantly lying to my family is really eating me up inside. I don\u2019t know how to be honest with them about what I\u2019ve been doing, and because of that I keep using to avoid thinking about it or feeling all this guilt. \r\n\r\nI\u2019ve felt for awhile now that I\u2019m just not a very good person, because of the choices I make through out addiction. But I feel like I\u2019m getting worse and worse every day, to the point where I don\u2019t even know who I am anymore or how to start trying to be better. \r\n\r\nOne of the things that breaks my heart the most is that I know my mom either knows I\u2019m using still, or at least is noticing that something\u2019s not right with me. But she won\u2019t outright say it. Anytime she\u2019s called me out for it in the past I\u2019ve lashed out on her. I say awful things, put the blame on her or anything else besides me, or I just become completely defensive and end up leaving / cutting off communication with her. \r\n\r\nI feel so awful for doing this to her. And everyone else in my life. I\u2019ve lost and pushed away so many people in my life because I chose to keep using and what it\u2019s turned me into. \r\n\r\nTomorrow, I\u2019m supposed to be 1 month sober. I know that my moms going to praise me for it because it\u2019s been almost a year since I\u2019ve been a month sober (when I went to rehab). Most I\u2019ve been able to stay sober since then is just under 2 weeks. \r\n\r\nI don\u2019t really know the overall point of this ran, and I\u2019m sorry if this isn\u2019t the right place to post this. I just feel really lost right now, and I don\u2019t know how to get out of the mess I\u2019ve created.",
        "answer": "You aren't a bad person, you're choosing to do bad things. Things that are bad for you and those around you.\r\n\r\nYeah, you're in a mess and that is probably triggering your urges/cravings, which feeds further into bad choices, more messy life, more urges, etc.\r\n\r\nThis isn't unique to you. Every addict knows exactly where you are and what you're going through. You're never alone, no matter how much it feels that way.\r\n\r\nThe good news is that you can make different choices. You got yourself in this mess, and you can get yourself out.\r\n\r\nWe're only as sick as our secrets. You have to be honest with your mother. I suggest talking to a therapist about how to do that in a productive and safe way.\r\n\r\nThis is assuming you're ready to try to recovery. If you're not ready yet, you still might have more messes to deal with and things will likely get worse for you before they get better.\r\n\r\nYou aren't a bad person, and you need to be willing to forgive yourself. You deserve love and happiness. But it will take work and time to pry those things from the chemicals that are trying to take over your life.\r\n\r\nGood luck.",

        "question": "how to open up to psychiatrist about how I'm really feeling Inside? Everytime I see my psychiatrist he always asks me how I'm doing and I always say I'm fine which is a lie. it's just I don't know how to open up and say I've been struggling emotionally. Basically here's what I want to say\r\n\r\nI don't feel like my depression is getting any better maybe a little bit in terms of taking care of myself more often but I still do struggle with taking care of my teeth that I've developed gingivitis.everyday I have to force myself to brush them. Im fatigued which I think is a side effect of my meds and I almost have no motivation. I still feel like life is pointless has no meaning I still have feelings of worthlessness. I'm emotionally overwhelmed and restless alot. I don't think my anxiety is improving. My sleeping is also not good I toss and turn a lot I don't sleep all the way through the night sometimes. I feel so disconnected I sometimes question reality and my existence I feel like I don't belong in this world. I've been struggling with passive ideations I experience emptiness everyday it feels like I'm going through the motions. I feel so hopeless I have moments of happiness for a while like if something makes me laugh or something but still feel somewhat depressed. I hate waking up in the morning the only thing I want to do is stay in bed all day and not deal with life. Sometimes I wish I could just sleep forever sometimes I think about killing myself but I don't have the courage to do it. if I had the courage to end my life I would. I feel so trapt in my mind. I feel like life is just too much for me. I feel like I'm existing for no reason. I feel like I can't be fixed.\r\n\r\nI don't know if that's to much to share because he's a psychiatrist and not really a therapist but I just need someone to know how I'm feeling and listen I want to be heard. \r\n\r\nSorry I don't know if that makes any sense.",

He  Managed to hold a job, maintain relationships etc. He was on methadone for quite some time. Not sure how long. \r\n\r\nRecently, I've noticed and so have my family, that he has become withdrawn and isolated.  Has lost his job and deflects any attempt to enquire how he is doing. And then recently he asked for money.\r\n\r\nI don't want to enable him, I also don't want to assume the worst either. Maybe it's something else. But i am worried. How can I help him best in this situation. \r\n\r\nThanks.",

Work can be very liberating, and grow positive qualities such as responsibility and independence, and teaches time and money management as well as other skills that will come in handy for future opportunities.  However, if you are being coerced into getting a job by people who are telling you that you're lazy, if you feel like you're being pushed into employment before you feel ready to take it on, it could end up being a bad experience, which can give you negative associations with employment that follow you into adulthood and make it difficult to build a career and make a living.

        "question": "My Dad had a massive stroke and I found out he relapsed. I think I\u2019m venting here, but please also give me all the advice you have. I just found something out that is weighing on me terribly out my dad. He (61M) recently had a massive stroke\u2014the majority of the damage was on his left brain. I\u2019m trying to stay hopeful about it but the doctors don\u2019t give me much hope. My dad was my families main provider, which consists of just me (24F), my mom (60F), and the dogs. I\u2019m trying to figure financials out right now and make sure we don\u2019t lose the house he worked his ass off for. My mom is beside herself so I\u2019m trying to do everything I can to help. This whole thing unraveled when I was trying to figure out where he rolled his 401k over to. He had changed jobs at the beginning of last year and I knew that this company didn\u2019t offer a 401k, so it had to have gone somewhere. \r\n\r\nI was scrolling through his bank statements and saw that he was withdrawing quite a bit of money at these two addresses that I ended up googling. Well, he was gambling again. It looked like he had started going to the two casinos nearby and playing FanDuel and what not in June of last year. When I was  younger, he had a really bad gambling addiction. To the point of almost losing everything. My parents almost separated but things worked out, we\u2019ve grown a lot as a family in the past ten years. He had worked so hard on himself to get better. He\u2019d gotten on some medication that really helped\u2014he has been severely depressed his entire life. I snooped too far into his phone and found that he downloaded BetterHelp in August of 2022. He was suicidal and looking for help with his gambling addiction. \r\n\r\nMy dad\u2019s addiction is something I hold a lot of guilt for because I know I should have talked to him about it. I\u2019m literally in graduate school, becoming a social worker. About a year or two ago, he and my mom had started going to casinos together again. They both knew I wasn\u2019t comfortable with the idea, I told them that he had an addiction like anything else\u2014you don\u2019t do them at all, not even in moderation. They didn\u2019t take it seriously. I know my mom didn\u2019t, even when I told her that I saw my dad playing an online casino game on his phone back in the beginning of January. She just said that he was making less with his new job\u2014I know see from his bank statement he was actually making more. I should\u2019ve confronted him. I wish I told him it was okay to talk to me, that I would\u2019ve helped him. There\u2019s so many things I wish I could go back and change :( \r\n\r\nI\u2019m afraid to tell my mom the extent of his addiction. I\u2019m also afraid to look further. I found where he rolled his 401k over to, I\u2019m hoping to god the full amount is there. I have to get guardianship of my dad before I can have access to it.

But I used 600 mg total this week, I sleep 8 hours and take a lot of vitamins (c, b complex and not vitamins, but also omega 3 and magnesium and zinc)to protect my body, but I feel like I\u2019m mentally adicted to this stuff. I am also suffering from huge anxiety since I am quiting pregabalin I am also addicted to, but insted of tapering of I take mega doses of it to survive the ritalin comedown and sleep. I used to have huge selfcontrol and abused in like once a month, but now I don\u2019t have strong will and I just snort or take my pills and than get this urge to communicate and socialize with people . It\u2019s not strong physical euphoria, it just makes me extremely motivated (to wrong stuff, usually just scrolling instagram) and I text people a lot of stuff I regret later. I used to love experimenting with drugs and had selfcontrol. Now I have depleted dopamine and feel really unmotivated and bored without ritalin. It\u2019s not physicall addiction, but I can\u2019t stop and since I am first year medical student it\u2019s really hard to do well in school. I tried replacing this stuff with weed or codeine pills, but nothing makes me feel as good as stimulants do. I sometimes use xanax (like 3x a week) to fall asleep faster, since It\u2019s hard even after taking 1050 mg of pregabalin  (it\u2019s also dangerous dose).

        "question": "I'm such a pathetic addict My gf just broke up with me. This weekend I drank enough to  kill a horse, smoked, cheated, watched tons of porn, played video games for hours. I don't know why I am this way. I don't know anybody else who is such a crazy addict. It's my defing trait and everybody knows it. Anything I like I get addicted to it.i went to the strip club once than went two more times that month, I popped a pill last month and then went on a binge for weeks, I relapsed watching porn this week and watched it 4 times today, a girl showed some interest in me and I went home with her even though I'm in a relationship because I'm addicted to attention, she ended up being a total psycho and kinda traumatized me with certain behavior during sex. I'm even scared to actually ask you all for advice because improvement seems impossible. My grandfather, grandmother, mom, dad, uncle .. are all alcoholics and have allot of personality flaws. I feel like I'm the most aware of how toxic and bad the family is but I still can't break out. I started using when I was 14 or 15 and quickly went from weed to heroin( not a gateway drug my ass) I quit opiates and benzos a couple years ago but I relapse every 6 months or so.i moved out young which really enabled my addictions because I've been able to do whatever I want since I was 16/17. I pretty much forced my gf to break up with me by disappearing for days. Because she deserves better. She's actually great and if I was more mature I'd be gaurenteed to have a good future with her. She loves me and saw I was a straight a student and talented at my hobbies and jobs . But I am just so fucking messy and she can't handle it anymore. I do bad things but I know they are bad and they eat at me unlike other family members.ive fealt so icky all weekend since I cheated but I had allot of chances to stop.  I feel like now that I'm single I'm about to go down a really bad path. I have no self control at all and I'm scared to. I'm scared to live a life without all these constant vices and temptations. I don't even know what that would look like or how I could. I mean I can't even get an hour of sleep if I'm not absolutely trashed . Anyways I guess I'm just venting I'm really upset with myself right now.",

Anxiety and whatnot.\r\n\r\n Only problem, is the only sleep I've had in the past two days was an hours nap and even then, it took me fucking forever of tossing and turning and deep meditation. (literal hours to drop off) and now It's the second day of no sleep, and I'm genuinely not tired whatsoever.\r\n\r\n My anxiety is all over the place at the moment and my mental health is plummeting I just wanted to know if anyone else with anxiety and mental health issues gets like this, and what helps you sleep when you get like it? Sorry if this is the wrong place to ask, I'll delete it if need be.\r\n\r\n It's just I've tried literally everything, I've meditated until my body went numb, I've read, I've gone on a walk, just lied there for a few hours- everything.\r\n\r\n But now I have to keep my damn headphones on and keep myself busy and distracted or my anxiety spirals into a\r\nConstant anxiety or panic attacks, (i don't know the difference but it just makes it hard to breathe and my chest and stomach hurt and I get so fuckin scared and I throw up n stuff) and I start experiencing Obsessive compulsions, and delusions which fucking sucks.\r\n\r\nSo yeah if anyone else with anxiety sometimes can't sleep for long periods of time cuz of it, please let me know what helps you.

My brother uses melatonin to help him sleep with insomnia. It doesn\u2019t have many side effects but it really depends on the person. \r\n\r\nI just watch YouTube or Netflix in bed until I get really sleepy and can sleep without thinking easily. \r\n\r\nI also sometimes just daydream in bed until I feel comfortable or sleepy enough. \r\n\r\nWeighted blankets and teddy bears have helped me. It\u2019s important to feel safe in your bedroom to sleep easily.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlso don\u2019t worry this is the correct sub",

        "question": "Are these valid reasons to report a mental hospital I recently stayed at? I just got out of the worst hospital known to man, which I will not be sharing its name, since I do not wish to stir up too much controversy in regards to it. I will however, say the terrible things I witnessed there, in my 6 day stay, and I want to get your alls opinion on whether or not this information is valid enough to submit a legal report on the staff.\r\n\r\nWORST OF IT\r\n\r\n-A troublesome 15 year old patient, let\u2019s say his name is James, was really pissed off, and he was having a really rough day, and was arguing with a staff member, let\u2019s calling him Joseph, the James said \u201cMan go die in a car crash.\u201d Joseph replied with, \u201cYour crazy dude.\u201d Then James replied. \u201cGo off yourself man.\u201d And then Joseph, THE NURSE, REPLIED. \u201cYOU go off yourself.\u201d\r\n\r\nThis enraged James and caused them to attack Joseph, quickly being subdued and strapped down and injected with a needle. \r\n\r\nAfter this, Joseph tried to silence me, and the other patients who witnessed it, saying. \u201cI didn\u2019t say anything, you guys saw us, you know that.\u201d And when someone spoke up saying the truth, that he did in fact tell the patient to kill themself, he began arguing with him. It ended with the staff saying they were going to \u201cinvestigate what happened.\u201d Even though he was still working there for the rest of the day, and the following day.\r\n\r\n-There was a kid with a mental disability, I sadly did not get to pinpoint it, but he had slurred, slow speech, and had trouble forming entire sentences, not that theres anything wrong with that. Let\u2019s call him Steven. He had a buddy there who we\u2019ll call Mark, Mark matters a lot in some of these stories.\r\n\r\nThere was a guy with green hair, well call him John, who was a nurse there, he actively ignored Steven, and oftentimes abused his power. John once actively was insulting Steven, reminding him of how he got there, upsetting Steven. Mark stood up for Steven, saying. \u201cWhat are you doing man, you can\u2019t say that.\u201d And as soon as that happened, John said \u201cYour barging in and arguing with staff, go to bed.\u201d And forced Mark to go to bed. And afterwards, I could still hear him bothering poor Steven from in my room.\r\n\r\n-Some of the staff would laugh and call Steven a \u201cBoxhead.\u201d Because of his head being moderately flat on the top. It made him feel horrible all the time, and he made that clear.\r\n\r\n-They had a \u201cQuiet Room\u201d or \u201cSafe room.\u201d Like all mental hospitals do, and when people are breaking down, even if they ask to go there, they oftentimes say no because they\u2019re \u201cIn there too much.\u201d And they just need to \u201cStick it out.\u201d\r\n\r\n-One day, one patient punched another in the face, all that happened was a stern talking to, and that was it. No serious repercussions, no joke, 5 hours later, I saw the staff playing cards with him, knowing what he did only a few hours prior. They were even joking about how he \u201cPopped them in the face.\u201d\r\n\r\n-One time, there was a female nurse, let\u2019s name her Jessica, and her and John were messing with Steven, saying he \u201cNeeded to go eat a salad.\u201d When Richard replied. \u201cThen I\u2019ll eat your salad.\u201d Not understanding how that sounds, they got him in trouble, even though he didn\u2019t understand what he said. Steven then asked him why what he said was wrong, and they said \u201cIt can be interpreted in different ways by different people.\u201d Even though he didn\u2019t mean it negatively, he literally meant he was going to eat a nonexistent salad she had.\r\n\r\n-My therapist was awful, she ignored me multiple times, I never got to have a one on one talk with her, not once, and worst thing she did was probably how when I was having a mental breakdown, she put her finger in my face and said. \u201cNot now, it\u2019s group time.\u201d All stern like. Legitimately having no sympathy.\r\n\r\nMODERATELY BAD.\r\n\r\n-Joseph would oftentimes call me and others \u201cFat\u201d saying we were \u201cSpoiled\u201d and \u201chave it easy.\u201d I am currently 240 pounds, 5\u20196. \r\n\r\n-Depending on how good you were, decided the quality of the food you get. 1-4 levels, I was always level 4, beginning to end, the best level, but I started off as everyone does at level 2, so I know how all the food works.\r\n\r\nIf you were level 4, you would get unheated chicken tenders, soggy hard fries, and a few other things such as corn or peas.\r\n\r\nIf you were level 1-3, you had to eat terrible stuff, examples being, A refrigerated packaged ham and cheese sandwich, a small fruit cup like the school lunch ones, and if your lucky, a banana, but only if they were nice and wanted to get up to get you one.\r\n\r\n-Probably the least important, but you had to raise your hand to get out of a seat, and you couldn\u2019t walk or pace, you always had to be sitting unless you needed water, or went to the bathroom. They\u2019re reason being \u201cWe don\u2019t know if you\u2019ll attack us.\u201d Even though the unit I was in was full of people who actually wanted help, and even the violent ones were respectful to them, case in point, the patient who punched another patient playing cards with the staff 5 hours later.\r\n\r\n-Lastly, you were not allowed to go into your room until nighttime, so you never got to have time to rest, they were always forcing you to be active and do group therapy, school, etc.\r\n\r\nI wanna get your alls opinions on this, and I will not be revealing any of the actual names nor the location, since I do not wish to cause too big of an upset",
        "answer": "Stuff like not being allowed in your rooms and that sorta thing, I assume different hospitals have different rules. I also assume this is in the US, and I live in Europe. That food hierarchy sounds very fishy. Usually hospitals should base their meals on nutrients and such. Again, highly questionable but not sure if this is unique to this hospital.\r\n\r\nBut just from reading the first point ABSOLUTELY YES. A nurse at a mental hospital (!!!) telling a patient to basically kill themselves is highly unprofessional. If the hospital doesn't actually take any action, that absolutely needs to be reported. The fact that he told you to be quiet means he knows he did something that could get him in trouble.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, I think staff (therapists included) treating patients unfairly isn't rare. I do think you should still report it. It is ultimately the reason why people often leave such facilities worse than when they entered.\r\n\r\nMy only concern is that no one is actually going to care about any reports made. But by reporting you did everything you could. And if it's possible, please do report this.",

I'm on autopilot at this point. i am high-functioning, with good grades in college. i feel so scared. just utterly terrified of people finding out, but i feel like this is a disease that i finally need to recognize that i have. since no one in my life can know, maybe if i post this i can get some sort of support so that i can feel not alone anymore.",

I tried to commit suicide last February but I called my best friend just before I passed out from taking about 20 zolpidem. My parents got an ambulance and to the emergency in time. \r\n\r\nIn the last 17 months I\u2019ve grown a lot, not because I really wanted to live or anything, I just got sick of feeling this way and thought, I\u2019m gonna give this one more big heave ho. \r\n\r\nI got better, I learnt things. Like, my depression is cyclical: no matter how much I improve it\u2019ll come back and kick me in the guts. So, sometimes I really just have to wait it out and cry and hide and do whatever it is to wait for it to pass. I learnt about more of my triggers, and I developed skills to cope. I spent money and time to sort out my migraines; I picked up crochet to have something to pour my feelings into. I developed tensodonytis from all the crocheting, and I spent more money and time fixing that, ending up with an expensive day surgery and I haven\u2019t been able to crochet since Nov/Dec 2020. \r\n\r\nI moved. Started to walk my dog every morning, taught my other dog how to pee in a tray coz he\u2019s too afraid to go out. \r\n\r\nToday, I\u2019ve been really depressed for 2 weeks and it\u2019s getting worse. The worse part is, my boyfriend is the one who triggered this round of depression, simply because he couldn\u2019t be kind to me. He told me to get my brain fixed so I\u2019d stop blaming him for all my problems. \r\n\r\nThe sad part is, he was also the one to push me past my breaking point when I tried to commit suicide the last time. He didn\u2019t come see me in the hospital. I was the one to reach out to him after I\u2019d been home a few days. We\u2019ve been together 3 years give or take. \r\n\r\nI want to believe in the good times we\u2019ve had together. The times when he smiles at me and everything is right in the world. When he confides in me and I lend him strength. And he tells me that he\u2019s IN love with me and that I\u2019m the love of his life. But I\u2019m too afraid to feels the good things because we usually end up in some fight or another soon after. \r\n\r\nI wonder if I\u2019m not kind enough to him. If I\u2019m the one pushing him to say these terrible things to me. I wonder if I\u2019m better off without him. But I know he struggles too and I help him through those times. \r\n\r\nI\u2019ve lost my train of thought at this time. I just want to be able to fight my fight with him being on my side. I want to be treated with kindness and respect and not hostility and impatience. \r\n\r\nThank you for reading to the end and I could really use some support right now. Be safe everyone.",

He\u2019s 7 years younger then me and just turned 12 which is around when my mental health severely turned for the worse. I think we have a lot of things stacked against our mental health both genetically and just environment we\u2019ve grown up in. \r\n\r\nOur mom died when he was 8 and I was 15 (she was sick for 4 years) and our dad is pretty fucking toxic. Living with him through quarantine had me so close to yeeting myself. At some point he decided me trying to take care of my brothers well-being was a threat to his authority but he barely steps in to take care of him so. He also basically isolated my brother from my moms side of the family (+his side lives far) and has yelled at me in the past for taking my brother to see my grandma.. he hasn\u2019t out right said it but I think he sees her as an enemy. Which sucks because growing up she was my best friend and my brother never really got to be close to her. I\u2019m not even close to my brother at all, even before I moved out last year, he fusses whenever someone interrupts him just being in his room alone on the computer and my dad would scream at me if I were to try to get him to do anything. And if I don\u2019t talk to him he won\u2019t talk to me for weeks Until something comes up I guess. \r\n\r\nAt this point I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m just like paranoid but I\u2019m scared of him falling down a dark path. I really don\u2019t know what to do to prevent?? Like were not even close so would I even know. I could advocate for him to go to therapy but I don\u2019t know how to advocate that without exposing myself??

And I tried to express to him that it wasn\u2019t good for me without totally outing my mental health.

I enjoyed every minute of it. \r\n\r\nThen, we had to change our plans and go to his place. No problem. I was happy and I love his family. But his mood changed. I was having fun talking to his mom and playing with his niblings so I chose to ignore it. \r\n\r\nAfter he sent me home, we were squabbling over text. I don\u2019t think it matters what we were talking about but I think he felt cornered. And there it was: the other shoe. He turned nasty and told me I wasn\u2019t making any progress with my mental health. I argued that I was making progress, it just isn\u2019t the kind of \u201cprogress\u201d he wanted to see. \r\n\r\nHe said, and I paraphrase, \u201cyour doctors may lie to you, but I will never do that. You haven\u2019t made any progress.\u201d\r\n\r\nSo I ended it. But I had \u201cended it\u201d so many times that he didn\u2019t take it seriously. He texted me the next morning as usual. I told him that I could not give him the kind of progress he wanted and that I needed to go at it alone. \r\n\r\nI invited him to come see me in six months and judge for himself my progress, but for now, I\u2019m breaking up with him. And here\u2019s what hurt the most. He said he wouldn\u2019t be there. \r\n\r\nSo here I am. I have no appetite, I\u2019m smoking too much, I\u2019m depressed and my brain fog came back. Oh and the migraines. And I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019m having my period but I\u2019m spotting non stop. \r\n\r\nBut I also feel\u2026relived. Like a weight has been lifted. The constant anxiety is gone. But I\u2019m braced for the pain to come in waves. My two dogs are with me. And they\u2019re very concerned. \r\n\r\nSorry I\u2019ve rambled on for so long.

        "question": "My wife had another breakdown Some background, My wife had a full blown psychotic breakdown in 2018 that required hospitalization. The facility she was in bounced from diagnosis to diagnosis just throwing stuff to see what stuck. They eventually released her but she was not ready and was still very delusional. She had associated the stories of abuse from another person to herself, when there was no basis of it at all. She refused to go home with me but thankfully would go home with her mother. She then spent the next two weeks refusing to speak to me until her medicine began to work and her delusions subsided. She eventually came home and began therapy and we thought she had moved past the trauma that caused the break to begin with. Fast forward to now, she recently decided to try her hand at retail work believing she had her social anxiety under control enough for it to work. It didn't, she had a panic attack last Thursday and quit the job on Friday.  she only got about 10 hours of sleep in the next 72 hours. On Sunday I witnessed her doing something out of the ordinary on our ring camera and when I asked her what she was doing she looked like she didn't realize where she was. I had to leave work and calm her down. She began showing the exact same symptoms as the last time , racing thoughts, delusions, memory blackouts and general confusion. On Wednesday I had left her alone to go to school because she was at times mostly coherent. I had to leave early and help her calm down again. Yesterday on the advice of our primary care I took her to a different facility around an hour away and had her admitted. I'm by myself at my house as my parents are out of town. All I'm asking for is good thoughts, prayers to whatever God you belive in and just general support while she receives treatment and hope they can figure out the cause of this and help her with it.",

I don't want to tell my family, because I already got a mentally ill brother and I don't want to burden/worry my parents further.\r\n\r\nAs a young child, I used to locked myself in my room while I had autistic meltdowns, so I was able to control where I directed my anger somewhat.

I'm even very protective of animals: Like I rushed out to save a baby pigeon after the tree trimmers cut down it's home.

My sleep has been horrendous over the last few days and thinking about starting school again is making me really depressed. I had all these big plans only for me to completely lose interest in all of them and lose touch with where I\u2019m actually headed. I don\u2019t know what I wanna major in anymore and I don\u2019t know if I want to study abroad. \r\n\r\nI have a feeling I might\u2019ve just experienced a hypo manic episode and do plan on talking to my psychiatrist about it.

I feel like it could be the dating apps that I\u2019m on that are causing this and plan on deleting them soon but I wasn\u2019t like this for the last 4-6 months. There was a period in which I went from really depressed to content, then from content to the over planning and everything, to now feeling like I\u2019m getting back in a depressive state. I felt ready to conquer the world and set out on my journey but now I feel really lost again. I feel like I\u2019m going nuts and I could really use some support and advice on where to go from here. \r\n\r\nIdk how much talking to my psych alone is going to help and I feel like I\u2019m going crazy here. Thanks so much if you made it this far \ud83d\udc99\r\n\r\nTLDR: I feel like I\u2019ve experienced a hypomanic episode. I went from planning my far future ahead/feeling on top of the world to now feeling lost once again",

It's devasting to see someone so depressed at the near end of their life & Idk what to do  hi, I'm the daughter of someone with dysthymia and major depression. I left the house at 16 because my father's mental illness gave me serious mental illness My father had a divorce and it devastated him to the point he can't see joy in anything, not even me. He calls me all the time to talk about how much his divorce ruined his life. His divorce happened 3 years ago and it was a marriage of 25 years. He does live alone. He doesn't shower, clean, or take care of himself. when I come to visit him I hear him crying alone in his room and isolates himself from everyone. He rejected help from his parents (when they were alive) and from our family members. This has been going on for 3+ years. He says that he will feel this way until he dies and that he will never be happy again. To hear that breaks my heart. I really want to help him.  It's devastating to see him so sad, and he is reaching to his final point of his life. (he is fairly old) What do I do, he has already seen doctors and he is taking his meds.

        "question": "I don\u2019t feel empathy for others, what\u2019s wrong with me? Why don\u2019t I feel any empathy towards other people? (doesn\u2019t matter if they\u2019re family members, friends or strangers, besides my mom) \r\nI do know how to fake my interest and kindness, but it\u2019s just not real. Most of the time I don\u2019t understand other peoples feelings and opinions and I don\u2019t even want to. I simply don\u2019t give a shit about them. I only care about people when they benefit me in some way, for example my dealer because i want his stuff or some random guy at the club because i wan\u2019t to hit, but as soon as you don\u2019t benefit me anymore, I\u2019ll cut you off or start treating you like crap.\r\nPeople often describe me as \u201ccold\u201d or that I lack empathy when they get to know me better, but at first I always seem to come off as charming, attractive and interesting. People also often find me very relatable, since I know how to copy their behavior and basically turn into exactly what they want to make them fall for me, which made me think and thats why I\u2019m here right now. I don\u2019t like when people ask me for favours or wan\u2019t my support/attention. \r\nPeople who seek my attention make me mad, I just can\u2019t stand it. Everytime one of my friends starts crying in front of me, I don\u2019t know how to react or act in general. I just get annoyed and tell them to stop crying. I hate hugging them, even when they ask me and always need distance between my and their body. As soon as they get close to me, I get angry. \r\nOnce my friend overdosed on pills in front of me, It didn\u2019t stress me out or made me feel anything besides anger and annoyance. \r\nI always knew that she was suicidal, but I just never cared enough to help& I know that this sounds shitty, but I can\u2019t help it. \r\nI called an ambulance for her while sticking my fingers down her throat, causing her to throw up since I didn\u2019t want to be involved in her death. \r\nWhen the paramedics asked me if I wanted to go to the hospital with her, I said no.\r\n(Mind you, we were at her house and only the two of us were home)\r\nI was so annoyed but also relieved that she was gone and I could finally have some peace. \r\nI just don\u2019t feel any empathy for her and her stupid \u201cmental illness\u201d. It makes me mad how much she talks about it and always needs to mention it to me. After she was gone I sat back down and finished the food we had cooked, cleaned up after myself and went on with my day. Today one of my friends told me that one of his close friends was found dead somewhere. I don\u2019t know much about it since I didn\u2019t ask, but he wanted to talk to me and asked if we could hang out to clear his head a bit. I know that I\u2019m supposed to feel bad for him and be there for him, but I don\u2019t want to put on a show just to make him feel better since it doesn\u2019t benefit me in any way. I stopped replying and acted like I wasn\u2019t on my phone. I wasn\u2019t sad or grieving when my grandma died unlike my other family members. This happened in 2018 and I still haven\u2019t cried once over it.\r\nI remember when she was in the hospital bed but I didn\u2019t want to go because it\u2019s \u201cboring\u201d and went shopping with my friends instead. The only grave I would cry on is my moms. I would do anything for my mom, but nobody else matters to me. \r\nBack when I was at the mental hospital, I often got kicked out of group activities (which I didn\u2019t like and avoided most of the times anyways) for being too careless about others and triggering the other impatients with my behaviour. For example in art therapy I used to draw very detailed gore pictures (I still make art like that, it\u2019s just my artstyle) which of course triggered a lot of the other people there. I got really mad about the fact that they were such crybabies since I never got triggered over anything there.\r\nI eventually got kicked out and threw a fit over it since I don\u2019t get why I would have to change my art just because some sensetive weirdos need to overreact. I didn\u2019t care when my best friend got raped, I didn\u2019t even feel bad for her. I didn\u2019t care when my dad murdered my stepmom, I even felt slightly happy since I didn\u2019t like her anyways. \r\nI hate people who openly talk about their \u201cmental illness\u201d or sadness. I hate attention seekers.

        "answer": "So many things could cause this; trauma, abuse, drugs, genetic disorders, chemical imbalance in your brain, mental disorders, etc. It sounds like you went through a lot of fucked up shit as a child, which permanently affects your brain. Your decision making, emotional regulation, and impulse control, among other things, could be outta wack. You're not selfish, honestly the problem might be that you distance yourself too much from emotions in general, and invalidating your own trauma leads to not caring about other's emotions. You're dealing with a lot of your own shit yet you're expected to act a certain way and put others first when you haven't even dealt with your own shit right now. This is honestly all just a guess though. You would have to go to a trained psychologist and therapist (not all of them are good and it might take a couple tries to find a good one), and really open up about all of this, and everything you went through, before you get some proper answers. Strangers on the internet aren't too helpful.",

        "question": "I don\u2019t feel empathy for others, what\u2019s wrong with me? Why don\u2019t I feel any empathy towards other people? (doesn\u2019t matter if they\u2019re family members, friends or strangers, besides my mom) \r\nI do know how to fake my interest and kindness, but it\u2019s just not real. Most of the time I don\u2019t understand other peoples feelings and opinions and I don\u2019t even want to. I simply don\u2019t give a shit about them. I only care about people when they benefit me in some way, for example my dealer because i want his stuff or some random guy at the club because i wan\u2019t to hit, but as soon as you don\u2019t benefit me anymore, I\u2019ll cut you off or start treating you like crap.\r\nPeople often describe me as \u201ccold\u201d or that I lack empathy when they get to know me better, but at first I always seem to come off as charming, attractive and interesting. People also often find me very relatable, since I know how to copy their behavior and basically turn into exactly what they want to make them fall for me, which made me think and thats why I\u2019m here right now. I don\u2019t like when people ask me for favours or wan\u2019t my support/attention. \r\nPeople who seek my attention make me mad, I just can\u2019t stand it. Everytime one of my friends starts crying in front of me, I don\u2019t know how to react or act in general. I just get annoyed and tell them to stop crying. I hate hugging them, even when they ask me and always need distance between my and their body. As soon as they get close to me, I get angry. \r\nOnce my friend overdosed on pills in front of me, It didn\u2019t stress me out or made me feel anything besides anger and annoyance. \r\nI always knew that she was suicidal, but I just never cared enough to help& I know that this sounds shitty, but I can\u2019t help it. \r\nI called an ambulance for her while sticking my fingers down her throat, causing her to throw up since I didn\u2019t want to be involved in her death. \r\nWhen the paramedics asked me if I wanted to go to the hospital with her, I said no.\r\n(Mind you, we were at her house and only the two of us were home)\r\nI was so annoyed but also relieved that she was gone and I could finally have some peace. \r\nI just don\u2019t feel any empathy for her and her stupid \u201cmental illness\u201d. It makes me mad how much she talks about it and always needs to mention it to me. After she was gone I sat back down and finished the food we had cooked, cleaned up after myself and went on with my day. Today one of my friends told me that one of his close friends was found dead somewhere. I don\u2019t know much about it since I didn\u2019t ask, but he wanted to talk to me and asked if we could hang out to clear his head a bit. I know that I\u2019m supposed to feel bad for him and be there for him, but I don\u2019t want to put on a show just to make him feel better since it doesn\u2019t benefit me in any way. I stopped replying and acted like I wasn\u2019t on my phone. I wasn\u2019t sad or grieving when my grandma died unlike my other family members. This happened in 2018 and I still haven\u2019t cried once over it.\r\nI remember when she was in the hospital bed but I didn\u2019t want to go because it\u2019s \u201cboring\u201d and went shopping with my friends instead. The only grave I would cry on is my moms. I would do anything for my mom, but nobody else matters to me. \r\nBack when I was at the mental hospital, I often got kicked out of group activities (which I didn\u2019t like and avoided most of the times anyways) for being too careless about others and triggering the other impatients with my behaviour. For example in art therapy I used to draw very detailed gore pictures (I still make art like that, it\u2019s just my artstyle) which of course triggered a lot of the other people there. I got really mad about the fact that they were such crybabies since I never got triggered over anything there.\r\nI eventually got kicked out and threw a fit over it since I don\u2019t get why I would have to change my art just because some sensetive weirdos need to overreact. I didn\u2019t care when my best friend got raped, I didn\u2019t even feel bad for her. I didn\u2019t care when my dad murdered my stepmom, I even felt slightly happy since I didn\u2019t like her anyways. \r\nI hate people who openly talk about their \u201cmental illness\u201d or sadness. I hate attention seekers. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m a bad person, but thinking of it, since it doesn\u2019t affect me most of the time, I\u2019d be fine with being an a-hole. \r\nBut right now my relationship with someone ended, because I was too \u201ccold\u201d for them. \r\nI do have to admit that I tend to become really aggressive and loud quickly, as soon as something triggers me and I can be really mean without even realising.\r\nSo, what\u2019s wrong with me, if there even is anything wrong with me?",

        "question": "I don\u2019t know how to stop grieving for the life I could\u2019ve had without ADHD I can\u2019t post this in the adhd sub so I apologize in advance, hope this is allowed here. I\u2019m feeling horribly alone and depressed about this.\r\n\r\nI finally got diagnosed in adulthood, and started learning coping skills and taking medication. \r\n\r\nI thought I had adhd since I was a teen. I was already in treatment for other mental health conditions, but every time I'd bring up adhd with a provider, I was dismissed without any further consideration (probably because I, and AFAB person, did not show the textbook male presentation of adhd / wasn't (externally) hyperactive). Instead, they chose to throw all kinds of anti-depressants, mood stabilizers, and anti-psychotics at my symptoms. Those medications never helped me. \r\n\r\nI grew up thinking I was just less than everyone else - that I was stupid, incapable, lazy, etc.. I watched people around me do everything I wanted to do and more while I fell short, and I never understood why. There's always been SO MUCH I wanted to do, but I didn't have the time management skills, nor the focus to learn and participate. \r\n\r\nAfter I started treating my adhd, I felt like I actually had some control. I didn't feel paralyzed and incapacitated by the simplest tasks. For the first time I was able to really explore my passions - I have always loved drawing, and in my late 20's I've finally. FINALLY. Been able to sit down and learn to draw. I love it so much, it makes me so happy. My art has helped my mental health immensely (although it scares me how hard it still is to draw when I'm unmedicated. And heck, how hard it is just to get through the day.)\r\n\r\nBut I don't know how to get over all the time I wasted not learning to do the things I wanted to, and now I'm years behind everyone else despite my best efforts. \r\n\r\nI don't know how to get over the fact that no one believed me when I was suffering. I feel genuinely traumatized by how dismissive they were, especially when I've come to find out how incredibly much adhd medications and coping skills have helped me.\r\n\r\nI know, I know... all I can do is move forward - there's no use being depressed about the past when you can't change it. (But, Good God, does it hurt.)\r\n\r\nAnd, even though I am more capable now that I'm properly being treated for adhd, I still struggle a lot day-to-day. \r\n\r\nEven trying as hard as I can, I just don't have the mental energy, time management, or executive functioning abilities I'd need to pursue all the things I want to do. I don't think I have an unreasonable amount of interests - I'd like to pursue my art more & maybe set up an online shop for prints or do commissions, learn to use a simple DJing app (a friend of mine hosts club nights, and I've always loved the idea of Djing), and of course I still have to work and keep up with the demands of my job (such as continuing education). I love yoga and meditation, and I'd love to explore fitness. Maybe read an occasional book.\r\n\r\nBut all of this on top of the basic demands of life - making appointments & plans, shopping and cooking for myself, being on time, getting to bed at a reasonable hour, and so on.\r\n\r\nI've already basically forgone the idea of ever getting back into singing or playing instruments like I used to, even though I loved it. I can barely fathom the idea of going out with friends, or even making more friends (I currently have only very few, almost none of them close.) I'm not even sure of how to execute the many artistic ideas I have.. \r\n\r\nI feel like I'm doomed to never be able to live up to my potential, because I have adhd. \r\n\r\nI'm doomed to always have to water down my dreams. \r\n\r\nI have to live the rest of my life watching myself underachieve.\r\n\r\nI have to live the rest of my life with the chronic stress and exhaustion of fighting my brain to get through each day.\r\n\r\nI'm stuck in this constant loop of mourning what I could've been; of trying to pick myself up out of the grief and depression this causes me. I'm tired and overwhelmed. \r\n\r\nI hope something, somehow gets better. I know I'll never get back the time I lost. But I hope I can somehow get better at managing. Because I do not look forward to living in this ADHD hellhole the rest of my life.",

I think being able to properly unpack the trauma of losing those productive years and learning CBT or DBT techniques to help cope with anxiety, stress, anger, sadness will help.

        "answer": "Hello!\r\n\r\nOK, let's focus on what you know.\r\n1. Your friends haven't cut you off, or stopped talking to you.\r\nThis suggests they still have positive feelings towards you and are still your friends. \r\n2. Your friends care about you.\r\nThey care enough to physically be with you when discussing something important. \r\n3. By your description, the subject of the conversation is going to likely be serious, but not directly connected to your actions.\r\nIf it was something you had done, they would probably have made reference to it, or you'd have an idea, eg \"we need to talk about the cake you threw into the lake last year\".\r\nThey care about you enough go talk to you in person about something serious, they may want your support and advice, because, again, you guys are still friends.\r\n\r\nIn this moment, you (presumably still) don't know what the conversation will be. I fully get the anxiety on that!\r\nSo let's focus on small things you have direct control over *right now*. How's your hair? Does it need a brush or washing? Do that. Take your time, do it carefully and gently. You have total agency of that.\r\nIs it lunchtime? You have full control and agency over that, given, I guess, time and fiscal constraints, so treat yourself if you can. Focus on what makes it so nice, textures, flavours, big portions, etc. Remember back to happy events around that food.\r\n\r\nAlso, I do something I call \"counting my blessings\" when I'm anxious. \r\nRight now, in this second, I am;\r\nWarm.\r\nIndoors in a nice house.\r\nIn a quiet place, feing safe.\r\nWell fed.\r\nLoved by my mum and dad\r\nTrying to help a stranger, and that makes me feel better.\r\nLater, I will;\r\nMeet my mum for tea.\r\nWork on my book.\r\nSleep in a soft bed.\r\nTalk to a friend about our shared hobby...\r\n\r\n...all nice, safe things, and I'm feeling more grounded and happy about myself now.\r\nIt can take a lot of practice and it doesn't always help, but sometimes it does.\r\n\r\n\r\nI'm sorry I wrote so much, but all the best for everything, and good luck going forward x",

Today, I overheard one of the friends in the chat talking to another saying \"He always overreacts about things, just let it fizzle down\" about my panic attack. I confronted her and she said I always overreact. I told her I was having a panic attack and said in the group chat that I was panicking and needed help. She said that a panic attack and panicking is not the same thing. True I didn't specifically say the words \"panic attack\" but I said I was panicking and needed help. No one even asked if I was OK. They just left me there after I said I needed help several times. The worst part was that part of the reason my panic attack started is because my friends call me childish nicknames and make fun of me, I'm afraid they think I'm annoying and don't like me. I don't think they do it on purpose. I don't know what to do. Help.",

I\u2019ve had my fair share of trauma and i was diagnosed with bpd at just age 16 and life has been pretty rough i won\u2019t lie. My depression rooms have been bad before, but never to this level. i\u2019m gonna be honest and open because i feel safe in the anonymity of reddit. \r\n\r\nAbout a year ago my mother spent a week cleaning my whole room of all its trash and it meant everything to me, i kept it clean for a good while but before i knew it it spiralled again (and i\u2019m holding a lot of guilt for ruining her hard work). \r\n\r\nFor months now i\u2019ve cried every night, i\u2019ve slept in the hallway when it gets too much, it\u2019s hard to even push my door open and i have to jump to get onto my bed. Most of it is clothes and trash and lots and lots of soda cans. The only space i have is one part of my bed for my body, it\u2019s so bad that the piles of crap on my floor are now taller than my bed. \r\n\r\nThis is so embarassing, i hate myself for it and all i want is a normal room. \r\n\r\n\r\nT/W : S*icide\r\n\r\n\r\nI won\u2019t go into detail, but last month i had an attempt. It\u2019s been one of many over the years, and it sprouted from hatred towards myself for living in this disgusting room. I don\u2019t let my family see inside, just my mother sometimes. She\u2019d love to help but she\u2019s sick, very sick.\r\n\r\nMy boyfriend doesn\u2019t even know how bad it is, he just knows its bad (mainly because he hasn\u2019t slept over in a year and i\u2019m always at his house instead)\r\n\r\nMy reason for this post is, for once i have the motivation to get it together but i just don\u2019t know where to start. I really wanted it done by christmas but It\u2019s overwhelming and i\u2019ll be doing it all alone. Please any advice you have would be welcome, i hate myself and i can\u2019t keep living like this :(",

I waiting a few days and sent 3 hours south to an awful tramatizing (place was rated 1 star with even more reviews). I left worse than I came it's makes me never want to ask or look for help again.

I get bed can be full.but to be let down and traumatized, I really can't handle that. I need more help than when I first asked it, already having terrible PTSD. Anyway to ensure a better chance of being admitted and ENTERING the facility you go to rather than being sent far away to a terrible place? Call ahead if they have beds?

        "answer": "Unfortunately, there is no way you can be guaranteed admission to a particular hospital. Mental health beds are few and far between in the US. Even if the hospital has open beds they may reserved for a particular class of patient. Review teams have a great deal of latitude on who they admit to their unit and may exclude people for various reasons. If you do call they probably will not tell you if they have open beds. There is no particular time of week or day behavior health facilities are slow or busy. From experience, if you have to be seen in the emergency department first the only guaranteed slow periods are thanksgiving day and Christmas morning.",

        "question": "This is why even the simplest tasks take up so much energy when you're mentally ill! So as someone who is depressed, basic hygiene, eating and self care are quite difficult for me. I know this is the case with so many other people, so I came up with a way to look at it from a different perspective! \r\n\r\nThink of any daily task, I'll use taking a shower as an example here! So for people who have the mental and physical energy to do stuff, who maybe arn't depressed, will see this as one simple task! Just showering, and while you're at it, might as well brush your teeth too! Now at least for me, that same \"simple\" task is divided into multiple tasks that have to be done after each other! \r\n\r\nMaybe something like this?: \r\n1. Find clean clothes\r\n2. Walk to bathroom where the shower is \r\n3. Take off clothes, jewelry and do additional preparing tasks\r\n      - Put dirdy clothes in the laundry bin/ washer\r\n      - wash your face\r\n4. Comb/ Brush hair\r\n5. Get into the shower \r\n6. Wash your hair with shampoo\r\n     - Apply shampoo\r\n     - Rinse shampoo\r\n7. Use conditioner\r\n     - Apply conditioner\r\n     - Rinse conditioner \r\n8. Wash body \r\n9. Rinse everything \r\n10. Get out of shower and find a towel\r\n11. Dry yourself with the towel\r\n      - Dry your body\r\n      - Dry your hair (add hair products if needed)\r\n12. Put on clean clothes \r\n13. Dry the bathroom floor\r\n14. Exit the bathroom, first making sure everything was put back into it's place\r\n- YOU'RE DONE -\r\n\r\nThat's ~14 tasks for us versus the one single task that mentally well people do! Think about each individual task taking up as much energy as it would take for a mentally well person to do the whole task! For different people it does vary what these individual tasks are, what order they're in and how many there are, but this demonstrates the overall consept! \r\n\r\nNow think about having to brush your teeth too \"while you're at it!\" 1. Gather the mental energy to do the task 2. go to bathroom if not already there 3. find toothbrush 4. find toothpaste 5. Wet toothbrush 6. Put toothpaste on toothbrush 7. Brush approximately 32 teeth! all sides! Every single one! 8. Rinse mouth with water (when done) 9. Wash toothbrush 10. Put toothbrush and toothpaste back to where they belong! \r\nYea.. This is also pretty much what it's like to do a task as someone who has ADHD... This is way harder than it should be and you might not be able to change that! Give yourself credit for even the smallest things, especially when you're already out of energy! :)",

        "question": "Is there anything that lowers emotional intensity? My body doesn\u2019t know how to feel properly. Good emotions are fleeting which yeah is also a problem but any negative emotion is felt at a 10/10 regardless of the cause. If I stub my toe or get in an argument or don\u2019t have a place to put whatever is in my hands down my brain goes crazy. Any perceived \u201cnegative\u201d whether or not it affects me I snap. My day is ruined I\u2019ll panic I\u2019ll hurt myself and I can\u2019t calm myself down. I know it\u2019s normal to feel bad sometimes but everything is to the extreme my perception of reality distorts every feeling into life or death. Can this be helped? will I have to cope forever? Do I need to be sedated all the time so I can\u2019t get that intense? Is there anything that makes existence less intense?",
        "answer": "Do you mean pharmacological or behavioral.\r\n\r\nLiterally every mood stabilizer and neuroleptic/antipsychotic drug reduces emotional intensity\u2014lithium, lamotrigine, seroquel, oxycarbozepine, and to some extent antidepressants, although to a much less extent, hence why bipolar ppl or ppl with PTSD or borderline personality syndrome aren\u2019t stable in A/D\u2019s alone. You might say that anxiolytic drugs reduce emotional intensity as well (e.g. clonazapam is used to treat mania or relapses to mania).\r\n\r\nMany of the anxiolytics are essentially sedatives or tranquilizers (alprazolam, diazepam), but there\u2019s a ton of atypical ones that are used off label that are not hugely sedating\u2014clonidine and guanfacine to list a few. Some of the tranquilizers (generally benzodiazepines since older ones like the barbiturates are even more dangerous) are not hugely sedating but will always have some sedating effect since they work to increase gamma-aminobutyric acid, the main inhibitory neurotransmitter in your brain. Alcohol also does this and it\u2019s why it reduces social anxiety but please do not go down that path.\r\n\r\nNeuro-Behaviorally it would be along the lines of meditation, breathing exercises, cognitive behavioral therapy (depends to what extent your weddedness to certain fixed beliefs is emotional for you), and other whole body oriented with mindfulness component practices such as martial arts, yoga, and tai chi.\r\n\r\nI would also suggest that a structured writing practice can diffuse the triggers that nudge you towards excessive emotional intensity. I think this is a part of dialectical behavioral therapy which was invented to treat a borderline personality, a condition notorious for erratic emotional fluctuations of high intensity.\r\n\r\nI personally use all of these strategies. Pharmacologically I take lithium and clonazapam, methylphenidate and bupropion, but it\u2019s questionable how much the latter two address emotional instability and intensity.  In theory methylphenidate (aka Ritalin) *should* but at the same stimulants can induce emotional instability.\r\n\r\nI follow a structured writing practice that is pragmatically oriented that I use to defang the weight or severity of life situations triggers etc. All that said I still suffer severe fluctuations towards very intensive negative emotions involving rage and suicideality. I actually requested due to this fact because I know where it leads to otherwise.\r\n\r\nI am in a life situation (2 years foreclosure) that is highly triggering to me and I think the stimulant and antidepressant I use can feed into unstable emotions (methylphenidate/ bupropion). At the same time My blood pressure is pretty high probably due to circumstantial and possibly pharmacological factors (both the Ritalin and the welbutrin can increases blood pressure) so am looking to initiate guanfacine or clonidine to replace them. \r\n\r\nI was given a single clonidine pill in the doctors office because my blood pressure was critically high and I have never felt calmer in my recent memory.\r\n\r\nIn any case I hope this helps and I wish you all the best. It is a day to day struggle. There are no silver bullets no magical therapies or gurus that have a simple solution for emotional regulation.",

        "answer": "Depression is and can be a debilitating disease and qualifies as a disability. It's a disease of the brain, a trauma or traumas. Part of what makes mental health so difficult is people don't feel like it's serious. Would you look at someone who is quadriplegic and say you don't think the injury to their spine is not a good excuse for not taking a walk? Or someone who has an intense fear of heights not an excuse to not become a utility lineman? Or had he lost his sight, \"How come you can't read your own menu?\"\r\n\r\nI'm not saying people never take advantage of it as laziness and depression can look similar to people. But that people *often* assume laziness or downplay the impacts of depression and anxiety. Mental health sufferers get a ton of ableism.\r\n\r\nAnd yeah there are days I struggle to even get up to take a piss.

I don\u2019t want to start restricting again but I\u2019m reaching the point where I can\u2019t help it.\r\n\r\nThank you guys",
        "answer": "Damn dude I don\u2019t have advice but that fucking sucks. \r\n\r\nThe one thing that might help you to consider is that it sounds to me like she is bringing it up so much - especially the fact that she\u2019s unhealthy - because she wants you to care about it. Idk how this sounds, because going about it this way isn\u2019t cool on her end (and this might not even be your concern) but if she does just want you to care, she clearly values the care you give her and sees you as someone who\u2019s attention she desires as she struggles. \r\n\r\nLike I know this might not change anything, but I don\u2019t think she\u2019s losing weight and feeling better than you or something. She clearly wants you to know she\u2019s unhealthy and to react by giving her attention. I don\u2019t mean that in an accusatory way, she probably needs it for real. But that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s easy or fair to feel like you have to respond with concern all the time for your partner to be ok. \r\n\r\nBut ultimately I don\u2019t think she\u2019s necessarily trying to compete with you or make you feel shitty about yourself, so much as get your attention because she feels inferior in your presence. She\u2019s probably far more wrapped up in her own perspective, which sounds pretty insecure rn tbh.\r\n\r\nEdit: I also want to be clear that I don\u2019t think it\u2019s insensitive of you in anyway to be triggered by your girlfriends behavior. If I were in your shoes I would also be super triggered and it\u2019s so kind of you to be asking how to support her. Remember it\u2019s ok to tell her what you need too. Her mental health is important but yours is too. I\u2019m just so sorry you\u2019re going through this and you can\u2019t find support from your girlfriend directly rn. I really hope that changes for you soon.",

        "question": "Issues with compulsive lying, need help with finding the correct treatment I have had problems with lying since I was in elementary school. It started as a way to get out of trouble, prolong any punishment my parents might dish out, stuff like that. It then turned it white lies and stupid things I would say in High School to make myself sound cooler. \r\n\r\nIm 21 now, and I just ruined a relationship with a girl that I was building for a while because of my lying. She cared about me, and knew I needed help, and pushed me to get it. It turned into me telling her that I had actually gone to a doctor and gotten medication, when i had not. She found out in October, and hasnt spoken to me since. \r\n\r\nI dont want to be doing this, its hurting me. Ive lost jobs, ruined relationships, and I dont think I can succeed in life if I dont solve this. What do I do? \r\n\r\nMy parents are willing to help me and ask what I want to do, but I genuinely dont know. They recommend inpatient therapy, and now we are researching it. Its not something that I want to do, but I think it might be good in the long run. I currently dont have a job and dont go to school, but I want to start a career as an electrician because trades are a great career. Should I do the inpatient therapy, then start that path, or can I do both at the same time. \r\n\r\nThanks for all the help",
        "answer": "\"Compulsive\" lying is a maladaptive coping skill people learn, not a mental disorder. People lie like this when they're taught as kids that telling the truth isn't safe and won't get them what they want, or will get them taken advantage of or hurt. Especially when there are narcissists around. And the second factor is when kids are \"seen and not heard\" and never taught to self-advocate or assert themselves.\r\n\r\nInstead of trying to \"fix the lying\" fix the reasons. Practice assertiveness, asking for what you want, maintaining boundaries, saying NO, and negotiating when faced with people asking you to do things you don't want to do or not giving you what you want. These are SKILLS that you can learn that are effective replacements for these kinds of lies.\r\n\r\nIn my opinion; going to a psych prison where you're going to have NO control, don't get to say no to anything, and don't get to ask for what you want is only going to reinforce the negative beliefs that make you feel like you have to lie. There is likewise no benefit to medication for this problem. Both of these suggestions strike me as \"you're broken so go do the thing I saw on TV and get fixed for my comfort\" rather than \"research.\"\r\n\r\nOne boundary I would start to set- stop letting your healthcare decisions be a \"we.\" **You** decide what treatment, therapy etc to pursue, and with who, and how, and when. When other people stick their nose across that line- Listen to what they have to say if you respect their opinion, and then tell them \"No.\" Even if you think they're doing it because they care, how it makes you feel shows through when you lie to evade it.",

        "answer": "Sorry in advance, this is long\r\n\r\nThere are a few things that come to mind, and please keep in mind that I am in no position to asses or diagnose anything. You should make an appointment with a mental health professional when you can, to discuss these things and look into further options. I know you said that\u2019s not an option right now, but it\u2019s worth noting there are some things that only they can help with (especially regarding medications and such). If you\u2019re not sure where to go, talk with your GP/PCP about wanting to get established with therapy or something along those lines. If you feel comfortable going into detail with that person though, some practitioners can prescribe medications for mental health as well\r\n\r\nWith that in mind, there are a couple things that come to mind. First, regarding the subject of those actions, it might be worth looking into your current diet and making sure you\u2019re not deficient in any vitamins. Vitamin deficiencies can create unusual cravings and unexpected behavior changes. If so, diet is the best way to get those vitamins, but supplements can also be used (just don\u2019t take more than the recommended amount, because you can overdose on vitamins as well). You can also talk to your doctor in the future about blood testing (metabolic panel) to determine more definitively where you\u2019re at with those things as well\r\n\r\nThe other things that come to mind are more mental health focused. But not in a \u201cit\u2019s all in your head\u201d way, rather, in a \u201cthese might be specific challenges you\u2019re facing\u201d way. Very broadly speaking, it sounds like you may be dealing with compulsions (\u201cdo this thing or something bad will happen\u201d), especially given that you find it near impossible to control them. I don\u2019t know about these, so I don\u2019t want to speak where I lack information, but it may be worth looking into more on your own, or with a professional \r\n\r\nThe other thing that could be a factor (again, not a professional and I can\u2019t say with certainty) is some level of dissociation. Dissociation is a disconnect between various aspects in experiences. This can include thoughts, emotions, memory, and even disconnecting from your own body or the world around you (depersonalization/derealization respectively). That \u201cwatching yourself do things from the back seat\u201d feeling is one I\u2019m very familiar with, having a dissociative disorder myself. Dissociation isn\u2019t always disordered though, I should note. Everyone dissociates some in their lives. If you\u2019ve ever read the same paragraph over a few times without understanding it, or forgotten the car ride home, those are examples of non-harmful dissociation \r\n\r\nBecause what you\u2019re describing sound like it is distressing and impacting your life negatively, it isn\u2019t my first thought that it\u2019s a normal level of dissociation. However, that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s disordered either. If you deal with a lot of stress or anxiety (which can also be tied to compulsions), that may be a factor, especially if you\u2019ve been dealing with that more recently before these experiences. This is also true if you have a history of prolonged stress or trauma, or if emotions are difficult to handle. Dissociation is a common coping skill for those things\r\n\r\nAll of this is to say that these can be normal experiences. Not necessarily average or common, but completely understandable and a normal human experience in the right circumstances. You\u2019re not alone. Even if there are different causes, you\u2019re not \u201ccrazy\u201d (few people who worry about being crazy actually are)\r\n\r\nIf you look into these things on your own, you may come across things like Obsessive Compulsive Disorder, or Dissociative Identity Disorder. This does NOT mean you have these things, just that there\u2019s symptom overlap. But just as I\u2019d sooner assume a sneeze is a cold and not cancer (even if that\u2019s a distinct possibility), I wouldn\u2019t jump the gun on all of the possibilities\r\n\r\nFor now, the strongest recommendation I can give is to focus on managing stress (try looking up grounding techniques), see if your diet is lacking in anything, and keep a log/journal about these experiences, especially as they do (or don\u2019t) relate to changes stress or anxiety. This way, you have documentation for yourself, but also to show any professionals if you take the step of setting appointments. It can help to identify patterns or triggers, and how to more forward from there\r\n\r\nBest of luck, and my DMs are always open if you need to talk",

        "question": "Could this likely be possible DID? I just need opinions[LONG] Tw: small talk of sh, dissociation\r\n\r\n(This is a second post about this. Original post was posted in r/dissociation. It didn't get many responses so im just looking for more honest opinions. Responses told me they might be a little biasd so i went here to a sub thats more general in mental illness i guess. Im not looking for diagnosis. Just advice and opinions. That's all)\r\n\r\nOver quite a period of time, I've been experiencing a range of symptoms that I find to be concerning and very scary. It really stresses me out and I don't know what else may be explaining all of my experiences so Idk I guess I just need opinions on if I'm being dramatic or sensitive or something about all of this. Or if it actually sounds serious to you. \r\n\r\nSo I'll just jump into everything that's happened and I'll try to make this organized. This will be lengthy though. \r\n\r\nThe blackouts: \r\n\r\nI've been having quite a few blackouts lately. They're all always unexpected and I never am aware of them until family members tell me and I'll just be so confused out of my life. They would blame me for doing something that I don't remember doing AT ALL and it'll always be something that I'll never do too. Like just never because it's absolutely nothing like me. But they all apparently saw me doing it and there have been evidence of it. And it'll just be so scary because it happens just randomly and I won't even notice it. I think so far I've had 4 blackouts, over a period of couple of months. Some of them happened really close to each other's times. One more recent. \r\n\r\nI could go into details about the blackouts but if I did then it'll be WAY WAY TOO LONGG and this is already gonna be long enough. I would say that I do suspect that I've missed a very important family event because of it. And someone had took over by maybe a couple of days because when I came back so much stuff was happening that I had no clue about and one of them even involved me which just confused me so much on what I've actually might've missed. The last thing I remember was just putting my stuff in my bag so I could leave and then just instant blackness. No idea what the Frick happened at all or what my sister was talking about or whatever. \r\n\r\nThere was also another blackout where I went to our presumed \"inner world\" and I saw the voices faces and their houses and their powers. That I didn't knew that they had. So if those things help then that's all I'll say. One of them people there who was a witch told everyone there that I wasn't allowed back in there anymore so I stopped going to that place after that blackout. \r\n\r\nWeird identity changes:\r\n\r\nThere have been some times where i would start to feel like an entirely different person. Or feel like I don't even know who I am and then I would just panic and deeply stress about it. I would do things that I would NEVER do like ever. And it'll be unreasonable honestly why i would just suddenly feel like that or think like that. Some of the things I'm just absolutely incapable of doing too like skill wise and knowledge wise. \r\n\r\nThe most recent time this happened was with painting. Now I am a good artist, i very much recongize that. But my drawing has kinda gotten worse. I can't draw realism all that well anymore and I have a very very hard time drawing heads. Nowadays I just paint acrylics and use whatever I have left of my drawing skill. There was this one time where I was painting and I was panicking over a mistake I did. I desperately tried to fix it so badly and I just did anything I could. When I started panicking though, I heard a voice in my head that just told me what to do to fix it. And then I even felt myself moving on its own, painting on its own. Painting completely differently than I do in terms of style and brush strokes. They were extremely precise and used brush techniques that I don't even know. What they did really actually improved my painting a lot and practically saved it. This voice had also forced me to just stop painting because they told me that I was painting in the same area for too long. Which I indeed was. I just needed someone to force me to just relax. \r\n\r\nThis happened again like four days ago or so. Like i said, I can't draw heads well and have a hard time sketching out the figures. But that time I just weirdly felt confident and I knew exactly what to do. I knew how to capture the figure and how to accurately draw each line. I felt just suddenly influenced with this knowledge. And when the feeling had gone away and I had tried again to sketch. It went absolutely terribly. I completely just gave up on it then. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe voices:\r\n\r\nI've mentioned them in the last section but I'm gonna go into some more examples of what they say and did and generally how I know they're not just \"thoughts\". \r\n\r\n1. One of them started speaking to me in Spanish, which I can't speak at all. I don't know Spanish at all besides me knowing how to just say my name in Spanish. They weren't telling me that though, it sounded like something much longer and complicated. I recognized only 3 words of what they were saying.\r\n\r\n2. They have agruments with each other pretty often. They also would just come to me and tell about something another voice did to them in the \"inner world\". One time, it was so so overwhelmingly loud because these two were just screaming at each other over something so fucking stupid and small. It was so so so fucking annoying. \r\n\r\n3. They vent to me sometimes about things that's really been bothering them. One voice in particular, I feel like we really bonded because of how much they shared with me. This is how I learned that a lot of them are carrying some serious tramua. \r\n\r\n4. There was a one time where a voice caused a blackout. I just started feeling them there, like right next to me in my head. And then suddenly I'm just overflooded with their laughter. My vision suddenly changed and everything appeared in a pink and blue color. Then things just went completely black. And I found myself in a different position on my bed. I don't remember them saying anything but I know they were there for sure. I even know their name. \r\n\r\nThere's probably more but I don't remember them. \r\n\r\nI've had a lot of out of body experiences and dissociative epsiodes. Two where I saw someone doing and saying something differently to how I speak usually. One where I saw someone try to harm themselves. I didn't really see it though I just heard someone saying that they were going to do that? I can't exactly see during these out of body experiences. I know they were stopped though by another voice I've heard. This was also kinda of a blackout too cuz i don't remember anything that really actually happened. Previously though, a voice was telling me that they were going to come out and hurt themselves so I just assume that's what happened. \r\n\r\nI would say more about that but I feel like this is getting too long already and I think it might be enough? I could always answer more in the comments though to clarify anything if this post was all just too jumbled up. \r\n\r\nOne more clarification! I never took any drugs or alcohol! I'm not diagnosed with anything or on medication for anything. My last clinician did told me that I had depression tho but I was never on any anti-depressants or anything. Idk if that was even a diagnosis I don't think clinicians can diagnose.",

Hey,\r\nso a lot of times recently I\u2019ve been thinking about when I started to self harm.\r\nI remember having so strong compulsive thoughts that were so so hard to deal with when I was idk 11, 12. \r\nThe thoughts were so strong that I wanted to do it but then told myself that I can\u2019t and that it\u2019s crazy.

I find myself blaming these days for not doing it bc I feel like I deserved it. To do it when I wanted to.\r\nThen I realized that I need to learn that it was kinda brave of me to overcome the thoights without actually doing it (eventho I still find myself coming back and thinking that I should have done it when others did at such a young age)\r\nI  remember doing something with a pin when I was 12 bc I saw boys in class do it.\r\nThen I started cutting when I was 13/14, more likely 14. \r\nMy mind says to me that 14 is too old and that I had to start younger.

It has been a while since I don't couple with anxiety by \"punishing\" myself, and I didn't do it today. I am so proud but anxious at the same time, because tomorrow is new year eve and I don't know if I would be as strong as today. \r\nIs only that I am trying so hard, and my best seems not to be enough. I am talking about today's family reunion. The problem was that sometimes my family members say hurtful things that desmerit my efforts. They don't do it with the intention of hurting me, but they did it. \r\nMy younger me would only eat her problems out. But I discovered that when I talk to a friend or someone else, the bad thoughts stop. I am talking to you, the person that is reading. But I am also talking to myself. Thanks for reading me. It's that sometimes, I need to remember that I grew, that I am not a child anymore, and that I can handle problems. And when I talk or write something, it helps. Yes, I can, and  I am good enough. So you are<3\r\n\r\nEdit: Thanks for all your support. Now is 2023, and I am doing well. I want to tell you guys that you can also reach me if you need to talk to somebody. Happy new year, I wish you the best :D.",

It makes me panicked about why I am there, why I waited so long, I fixate immediately on everything I ate or will eat, etc. everything goes into hyperdrive.\r\n\r\nToday I finally went, with guidance from my nutritionist. I am proud of myself for coming home, and still having a favorite beer...It\u2019s Friday, after all. I made a (half) joke to my partner about wasting my gym time on just this can here.\r\n\r\nHe proceeds to add on to that statement, that I made us both such giant salads for dinner... and he really could have had a third less even.\r\n\r\nIt just entirely destroyed me inside. He knows about my bulimia, but I don\u2019t express the struggle I am always going through. I am far along in my recovery, but still have plenty of bad days. \r\n\r\nI feel like I am not sick enough anymore for him to understand or take it seriously. He kept expounding on how much was in the salad, and it really hurt me inside. I felt good about the things in it, and he can always make his own salad if he wants I was just trying to be nice.\r\n\r\nHe\u2019s asleep so I haven\u2019t talked to him yet, and I just excused myself from the table at the time. \r\n\r\nI think I\u2019m just upset because in that moment I needed support, not criticism. Also it was a salad. He has said before he thinks I eat too much the few times we\u2019ve talked about it, and I don\u2019t think he realizes how destructive that language is :(\r\n\r\nI think I\u2019m being overly sensitive but I am still just very upset. I grew up with all my food being restricted and monitored, and don\u2019t want that for my current life. I know it\u2019s in part paranoia that I\u2019m being watched and judged, but that type of comment just feels affirming in my concerns.\r\n\r\nNot sure what to do, any advice is appreciated.",
        "answer": "First off, you're not being overly sensitive. You have a right to have feelings about what he said.\r\n\r\nAlso, it sounds like he may have a skewed view of eating healthy if he thinks it was unhealthy just because there was a lot of it. \r\n\r\nIt sounds like you may need to set some boundaries with him when it comes to talking about food and dieting and such.\r\n\r\nDefinitely talk to him and keep an eye out to see if he corrects himself. Many people recovering from eating issues have people that would hold them back on purpose just to keep in control of that person.",

I tried to post this a few months ago but never really plucked up the courage because I was in denial about having an issue, but I think I need some help - preferably from people who have some perspective on the issue.\r\n\r\nFor context, I used to be overweight and decided to go on a diet last year due to joint problems. Losing the weight felt great in terms of self confidence and general mobility but I realised once I hit my current, healthy weight, I got depressed about my results not being 'good enough'. I find myself hyper-analysing my body constantly and thinking I 'need' to fit into certain clothing sizes and taking huge blows to my self confidence if I don't. During my initial weight loss, counting calories wasn't a big deal to me but now I'm obsessed.\r\n\r\nThe thing that actually triggered me to post this is when tonight after dinner, I frantically rushed around the kitchen picking up all the food items I had eaten that day and tallied up how much everything was. I even picked a packet out of the trash to do it.\r\n\r\nNobody in my life knows I do this, not even my partner who I consider my closest friend. I hide it from everyone because I'm afraid that if I tell anybody then I'll be forced to eat too much and gain weight (I had an issue with my parents doing this to me in childhood). I know my current behaviour isn't normal but I haven't tipped fully into purging/restricting/etc. so I feel like I have some time to prevent what's going on if I know how to. The articles online are focused more so on people who are actively dealing with EDs, which is understandable.\r\n\r\nAny help is really appreciated. I know a lot of people with mental health issues/addictions always wish they could've given their younger self some advice so if anybody has anything, please do tell.",
        "answer": "Hi there,\r\n\r\nI work with people with ED. I can imagine what you're experiencing is very mentally taxing. \r\nI like to ask people to imagine their ED as a voice in their head, talking to them and commanding them to do certain things. You're there as well and fighting against it, but sometimes, it wins the argument and you're then forced to do what it says. I'm sure part of you wanted to just be normal after your dinner, but your ED (or the beginning of, or whatever you want to call it) ordered you to go count every calorie, and it succeeded in that instance.\r\nI hear that it hasn't gotten to the point where it's making you adopt purgatory behaviors, but I want you to realize that you've already entered into a phase of restriction. You can look up the binge-restrict cycle if you're not familiar with it. It's not a healthy cycle to be in. Eventually, the ED can become stronger and weaken your own will to stay healthy.\r\nHow to get rid of it ? First, you need to understand that healing from ED is a non-linear process. There will be relapses, and it's normal and it's okay. \r\nYou will also need to build a network around you. ED is not something you can fight on your own. I know it might be hard to even imagine telling people at this point, but the people that really love you will care and be there to support you through this, there's no doubt about that. Allow them to be there for you.\r\n\r\nA good ressource I like to recommend is the book Life without ED by Jenni Schaefer. The author talks about her experience getting rid of her ED. I think it could be a good start for you. You can also look into support groups in your area. They're usually free services offered by non-profits, and you could get to share with people living similar experiences.\r\n\r\nRemember the first step is to acknowledge there's a problem, and you've achieved that already, you can be very proud of yourself. Keep loving yourself, and best of luck :)",

        "question": "Struggling to stop using cocaine, could use some support I had done coke a few times before at parties etc when offered, but last summer I started buying my own. At first it was purely recreational, I liked feeling more confident and going out to dance with a bag in my pocket. Mostly weekends, sometimes I'd get a bag and go out on a weeknight, and it'd last me a couple of days. \r\n\r\nWell fast forward a couple of months, and it started catching up with me. Tired all the time, depressed, no motivation, work performance slipping. That was the tipping point where I should have stopped. Instead, I started bringing it to work, where I'd dip out of the office every hour or so for bumps in the bathroom. I was basically self medicating my ADHD with coke instead of Adderall. \r\n\r\nOf course, I didn't stop using when the work day ended. I'd get home, go to the bar and make conversation with strangers in between trips to the bathroom.\r\n\r\nThat was back in September. I've been going through a gram a day for about 4 months now, and I'm paying the price. I really want to stop, but during the week I'm afraid I won't be able to function at work, and when the weekend rolls around I just wind up partying again.\r\n\r\nIm thinking of taking a personal day this Friday, deleting my dealers number and taking the long weekend to jump start my recovery. I'm going to delete my dealer's number, try my best to go to the gym or at least do some walking outside, pick some comfort movies to watch - if you want to drop any more tips I'd be grateful.\r\n\r\nMuch love to you all!",
        "answer": "Hi there. What a deja vu. I\u2019ve seen this movie and I know how it ends\u2026 \r\n\r\nIn my case it was 2016. I was at the same spot\u2026 In a span of two weeks, work got so stressful, I did so much coke one night that I could not get out of my room next morning. Had to call in sick. And again. And again. I lost control. I lost the job. \r\n\r\nCocaine addiction can escalate pretty fast. I spent about two years (2015/2016) in heavy addiction. I mean heavy. Four day benders. Almost oded a few times. Nothing made me stop, until I lost my job and it hit me in the face.\r\n\r\nI tried to quit on my own for a while, I spent three months in bed eating and sleeping and fighting the urge to go out and buy more. Then I had a nasty relapse. I only got the grip on recovery when I started seeing a therapist. She helped me get my life back on track.\r\n\r\nSo my tip, from someone that has been in the ups and downs of coke recovery since 2016, is get professional help. Go to a group or get a therapist, or a doctor. It\u2019s so much easier and effective when you have someone guiding you. \r\n\r\nBe patient and be strong. It took me several months to stop shaking and feeling dizzy out of the blue. I felt numb and stuck for a long time, until I started going on long morning walks, that really changed everything. Go to bed early, try to go for walks in the sun, lots of sun, eat heathy (but keep ice cream in hand, ice cream is wonderful to cut the cravings) and keep busy during the day. Keep so busy that when party time comes you are so tired, all you want is a good night sleep. You will thank yourself in the morning.\r\n\r\nAlso I had to change all of my friends. I only felt really free from coke in 2021. I almost slipped back during 2020\u2026 Had to let go of all my party people. Up until this day, I don\u2019t trust myself around coke, so I avoid people and places where I know there will be blow.  \r\n\r\nThe hardest thing you already did, that is admitting you have a problem. You can do this. Trust me, it\u2019s worth it. Life is so much better without cocaine. \r\n\r\nGood luck!!",

        "question": "18m with acute psychosis He was involuntarily committed to the psych ward.  I went to see him and he's worse now. He's still saying random things and twitching. He stared at me without blinking for minutes at a time. They've been giving him xyprexa. Please tell me he'll get better.  Is this going to be his life? His symptoms got worse so fast. Other family members in my home don't want him to come back. He has nowhere else to go. The social worker told me to be prepared for him to end up in the homeless shelter. He just turned 18. He doesn't understand what's going on and they wanted to release him today. He will end up dead if I dont let him come back home. My other kids will hate me if he comes back. I'll have to sacrifice their mental health for his life. Someone, please tell me he'll get better. He's been there 2 days and he'll be staying for at least 4 more days until they have a hearing. Honestly, I can't even remember what the hearing is for I was just so grateful they were keeping him. I'm meeting with him and the therapist today. Everytime I look at him I die a little more. I just want to see him be happy, for him to be able to have healthy relationships with people. He doesnt deserve this. No one does.",
        "answer": "I am not a professional by any means, but as someone who struggles with severe mental illness and has gone through multiple treatments, keep focusing on trying to help him understand that he hasn\u2019t done anything wrong - mental illness is not his fault. The therapist should be able to facilitate these conversations and provide additional advice in this situation. As for his symptoms, it may take some time to find the right medication or combination of medications, but there is absolutely treatment that should allow your loved one to live a happy fulfilling life. It seems like a lot, and it is. But you (and your loved one) can get through it as many others have. \ud83d\udc95",

        "question": "My final exam is near, but my mental health is getting worse. Any advice?",
        "answer": "Therapist here! No worries! Theres lot of things you can do to keep youself calm, depending on what works for you.   \r\n\r\n\r\nMusic therapy - youtube or spotify relaxing and calming music to help you reduce your heart rate and calm your breathing if your anxiety gets bad. Take your time with it.   \r\n\r\n\r\nJournal - write down your anxious thoughts. what worries you the most, is anything else bothering you, are you catastrophizing?   \r\n\r\n\r\nTalk it out - do you have a family member, friend or classmate that would be willing to listen to you vent and air your concerns?   \r\n\r\n\r\nTherapy - if its within finanical reason, consider speaking to a therapist!  \r\n\r\n\r\nDissociation - I love using this technique. You know that little voice in your head that tell you youll fail, there isnt enough time, youll get kicked out of school, your parents will be so dissapointed etc etc? I cannot stress this enough, this voice is not you! Just becuase you hear it in your head does not mean it is true. A good method for this is one of my favorites. Imagine for a moment that you are sat on a sofa, and this voice in your head saying all this negativity is another person sat with on on this couch. Listen to them talk. Listen to how they ramble on and on about all this negative stuff. Its getting tiring, annoying and frustrating. So walk away! It sounds silly to some, but making this kind of distinction of \"I am ME and I am NOT my thoughts\" is an incredibly useful tool.   \r\n\r\n\r\nMeditation or self hypnosis - as a hypnotherapist, i may be bias here, but hear me out! Meditation and self hypnosis is an incredible tool to ease mental health and stress issues. There are many guided tools available online, you just have to find one that speaks to you!   \r\n\r\n\r\nI hope this helps you!",

        "question": "Too Anxious to Play Competitive Online Games  Hi all, I\u2019ve had this issue for a long time now, probably ever since mid-college, but I\u2019m not sure where it started exactly. Right now I\u2019m out of university, been in the workforce for about 4 years, working from home mostly. \r\n\r\nI know you read the title and it sounds silly, but it\u2019s actually really affecting my life.\r\n\r\nI used to be a really competitive person- I really liked it when I would go online, play for hours, beat people down, win games, and improve my skills. But lately, when I try to get into a competitive game (basically any game with a ladder/ELO matchmaking system), I become almost paralyzed with fear at pressing the \u201cStart Match\u201d or \u201cFind a Match\u201d button. \r\n\r\nI\u2019ll finally get some free time away from family or work, and I\u2019ll be like, \u201cOk, I really want to improve at this game.\u201d I\u2019ll sit down and just watch my mouse hover over the \u201cStart Match\u201d button for what seems like hours. I\u2019ll end up watching like dozens of Youtube videos on random garbage.\r\n\r\nIn the end, I\u2019ll either just play one or two games, and it\u2019ll be like 3:00 AM so I have to sleep, so I\u2019ll stop. **And for those games, my heart will be beating out of my chest, I\u2019ll sweat like crazy, my hands will shake. It\u2019ll look like I just came off a jog outside or something.**  \r\n\r\nThen, I can\u2019t sleep. My mind feels like I haven\u2019t completed what it set out to do, so I\u2019m restless for hours. I\u2019ll end up sleeping at ridiculous times like 5 or 6 AM on a workday.\r\n\r\nSo then after the weekend or the follow workday, I\u2019ll feel so unsatisfied or unrested. Then the cycle repeats.  \r\n\r\nMy friends will talk about how they were able to *relax* and play dozens of games in one sitting. I see streamers and youtubers just instantly play one game after another, no hesitation. And I\u2019m sitting here like *how?* Like, what\u2019s wrong with me? \r\n\r\nIt\u2019s so stupid. There should be nothing to be afraid of. Yet my body reacts like I\u2019m about to box 10 rounds or something. \r\n\r\nBut even though I have this insane reaction towards playing, these games are still *so much fun.* It\u2019s so satisfying to win, or even lose and try to learn what I need to improve on. Even when I get beat down, it\u2019s exhilarating. I want to keep having this fun without feeling like crap.\r\n\r\nAnyone else experience something like this? Was anyone ever able to get over it? Let me know!",
        "answer": "Similar but different situation going on with me. Was never a competitive guy but would be able to spend 4 hours plus playing a story based game. Now I can't get myself to sit down for long enough to make any progress. It used to be an escape for me but now it's just depressing that I don't have any interest in doing what I love (other hobbies as well).\r\n\r\nFunnily enough I've been able to play MW2 with some friends most nights, I found that the quick nature of it didn't stress me out as much as the thought of committing hours to something. Not sure why as I haven't liked multiplayer shooters since World at War.\r\n\r\nSounds like we may have traded a little I guess.",

        "answer": "That is something you have to admit truthfully to yourself. As someone who works with addicts, and is personally affected by life with an addict-there is no point in others telling you you have a problem. You have to find that truth in yourself and admit that you are powerless over cocaine. Being powerless doesn't mean you can't quit, it means you know that one is too many, and a thousand is never enough. If you can't put it down, and one line is never enough, you know you don't have power over cocaine, cocaine has power over you. If you feel this is true, then there is hope and there is an answer-sobriety. \r\n\r\nLife without that cocaine can be beautiful, and the cocaine use does not dictate a good time. You do. Your body, mind, finances, social life and future will all be destroyed if you keep on this path. You deserve a good life, you deserve to be happy, and you deserve freedom. I have had unsuccessful resuscitation of patients who went into cardiac arrest from use alone, or from patients who had their cocaine cut with fentanyl or other harmful tranquilizers. Every addict thinks-its not going to happen to them. That they're the exception. Please take care of yourself, there's a good world out there. It deserves you in it.",

It's something that my husband is struggling with right now after finding out his son is turning 18th is year. He found out that his(husbands) family abandoned his son too.. husband wasn't in the right way to take his son (few years ago before he and I the state was trying to get him to take his son) he was in deep with his addiction at the time.

(he's kept in contact with son) and now he's battling his own feelings about his family and the SA that occurred as a kid. trying to process his feelings about his son and what to do.

        "answer": "Hi, there. Fellow coke addict here.\r\n\r\nWhen I first tried to quit coke, after a few years of heavy abuse, I managed to get three months clean, and when I was feeling better I started yoga. I felt so good and so happy about it! Guess what? I relapsed hard. Got a few more months clean, was feeling so happy, relapsed.\r\n\r\nWhen I finally decided to get help, one of the first things I learned in therapy is that an addict\u2019s comfort zone is down the hole. Our minds tricks us into not accepting happiness, like if we don\u2019t deserve it. It\u2019s a mix of guilty and fear and self-sabotage. So you have tools in therapy to reset this behavior and go back to \u201cnormal\u201d.\r\n\r\nTo me it was a long process of learning to love myself, to love and cherish my life, my family, my friends, my work, my clients\u2026 I used coke as an escape from some really bad depression and self-destructive behaviors I had long before cocaine entered my life\u2026 I sabotaged myself in other ways, with over drinking, always feeling defensive and criticized, always angry and jealous, having meaningless one-night stands with strangers\u2026 When I tried coke it made me feel awesome and sexy and dangerous and edgy\u2026 Wow, it was the recipe for disaster and I was instantly hooked.\r\n\r\nFast-forward to rock bottom loosing a job and almost dying, I go to therapy and learn all this awful things about myself I wasn\u2019t aware before.   \r\n\r\nMy point is: if you really want to quit, get some professional help. A good therapist can help you discover your triggers, your motives and how to break this pattern.\r\n\r\nMy tools have been routine, creating good new habits, getting close to nature and sunlight, and gratitude. Be grateful. Take a look around, pay attention to all this good moments and people you say you missed, and tell yourself you deserve it. You deserve this happiness, you deserve your job, you deserve this guy you like, you deserve your your family and friends. Convince yourself how important you are to them, and how they want you to be there, and you will be your best self to be there for them and to cherish this moments.\r\n\r\nRecovery can be painful, therapy can be painful, but it really pays off. Of course life is not perfect and there will be bad days when you feel defeated and tempted to go down the hole again, but there\u2019s a point you can reach when you identify the exact moment you want to self-sabotage and you go for a walk or have an ice-cream instead of stuffing your face in blow.\r\n\r\nUse this moment of venting to take control of your life, you have the right motivation! \r\n\r\nTake care and good luck!",

        "question": "Effects of my Secret Addiction I honestly feel so lonely in life. I feel like I don\u2019t really have anyone anymore. I don\u2019t have close friends to hang out with, I don\u2019t have people I don\u2019t to on a daily basis, I feel like I\u2019m someone who is not really missed or cared for by peers. Sometimes it seems like no one cares to associate themselves with me. \r\n\r\nI feel isolated. I feel as if I don\u2019t have anywhere to turn. Feel like I have no one to talk to. \r\n\r\nI\u2019m predominantly lonely in my romantic life. I don\u2019t have hope I will have anyone, it seems too good to be true. I put myself in this predicament. My one relationship that I can\u2019t break is pornography. At this point, now I\u2019m just going to pornography to fulfill the bodily pleasures I have, but to fulfill the loneliness I have. The sad thing is, I know it\u2019s the very relationship with pornography that has caused me to be lonely, caused me to seek out strangers on anonymous chat forums, caused me to go out less and become antisocial; caused me to become depressed, less motivated, anxious, stressed, dependent on pleasure, empty, calloused, broken, ashamed. \r\n\r\nI feel I can\u2019t produce healthy relationships, friendly or romantic. My focus of romantic relationships become solely based on physical intimacy, not necessarily sexual, but touching and feeling through hugs, holding of hands. I know relationships are much more than that and certainly much deeper on an emotional and spiritual level than physical. \r\n\r\nPornography has warped my view on others, myself, relationships, reality. It has helped me to isolate myself, develop trust issues, become broken and breaking others, distort my thinking, pervert my thoughts; prevented me to succeed and live a healthy, proactive life. \r\n\r\nI hate myself. I hate my lifestyle. After doing something for so long, you\u2019re so used to it, that though you despise it, you can\u2019t seem to break it out of comfort. \r\n\r\nPeople can recognize drug addicts, alcoholics; any sort of addictive behavior. The hardest one to identify is pornography or sexual vices overall. I wish someone can recognize it and say to me, \u201cI know what you\u2019re doing\u201d that way I have no other choice but to get help.",

We can't stop what we are doing, don't know why we do it, keep returning to it for a false sense of comfort or self medication.\r\n\r\nThe bad news is that it never gets better, only worse, UNLESS you reach out and get some help. \r\n\r\nThe good news is there is alot of help out there.\r\n\r\nThe nofap sub here is a great place to start. I also recommend seeing a doctor and explaining how you feel so they can at least steer you to someone who can help with the emotional side of all of this\r\n\r\nI appreciate you feel awful but please take these first steps.

Peter never had a history of any mental problems, Mike has some mild anxiety problems currently in therapy and I am diagnosed with anxiety and panic disorder. We were having a debate today that family/marriage/kids is not happiness for everyone. Peter was claiming that me and Mike need to find partners and \u201cfree ourselves to be able to have family, we are miserable because we are comfortable with our \u201cweakness\u201d aka mental problems\u201d. Me and Mike were insisting that you need to be happy with yourself first in order to be happy with someone else and Peter was just saying that we both are weak and we need to go and enjoy our life outside this weakness to be able to get rid off any problems. This just made me furious, why some people think that in order to \u201cbe happy\u201d you just need family?

        "answer": "Firstly, congratulations. That's quite an achievement.\r\n\r\nLet's look at things another way. Say that you were to start smoking a little weed, here and there. Giving yourself the permission and taking on the personal responsibility of doing so. Aware of the risks as such, that you may branch out a little bit, here and there - and then maybe - have a few blowouts. That's entirely a reasonable possibility. Who knows really what the consequences of that might be.\r\n\r\nMore than that though, how would/might this impact your relationships? With your wife and children? What's the worst possible outcome that you might face here? What's the best possible outcome you could achieve? And looking at both of them; is the person you want to be?\r\n\r\nIt would be unusual for you not, from time to time, to have intrusive thoughts. If you're tired, from not enough sleep. Or maybe you're not interacting enough in meaningful relationships with people; your environment really plays a massive role here. Well, it can start to play a trick or two on you. You start to have doubts; \"Oh, just once - what harm can it really do?\" \r\n\r\nSometimes you just have to acknowledge that you're not feeling great about life or some aspects of it. And then just say; \"Okay, so I'm feeling / thinking these things. They're just thoughts. I don't need them, so I can let them go.\" And you really can. That's the power you have now; you can make a choice. Sometimes we don't realise how much influence in the outcomes of our lives, and that there is a space for us to make a choice. We can influence our impulses.\r\n\r\nI wish you well. I really do. You made a choice to come and get support. That's shows you have a level of depth and maturity. That you care. Things may still provoke or irritate you, but don't forget that you have come so far already. And you still have a way to go. Just how that turns out, lies at your feet.",

        "question": "Bare with me please I\u2019m an addict taking that hardest first step. I became an meth addict. I quit Friday morning. I\u2019ve always been a functioning addict but when I lost my live in gf of 5 years, a few weeks later my company sold and my management position was eliminated and I was partnerless and jobless in a big house that requires two earners to afford. My abuse went into over drive. I was using it to cope with what clearly was depression setting in. I played the tough guy and pretended I was doing fine and things were getting better. I moved closer to family and yet continued my self destruction. I\u2019m sure they\u2019ve noticed but I thought I hid it. After a few months I found a good job so I thought. I watched for other opportunities as upper management worked me to the ground. So I continued using on the same pace as I had begun after the breakup. Finally one day before Christmas I sat with my boss and said I can\u2019t keep working into the ground and watch my life balance completely disappear. I wasn\u2019t able to date to see friends and I saw my family less than when I lived in another state. Our separation was ammlicable.  But I continued to use. Haven\u2019t found a job and have done nothing but stew about what came and went in my life this year and how a habit is clearly to blame in a lot of this. I\u2019ve slept much of it off the last two days and I\u2019m not fuzzy mentally at the moment. But the emotional havoc my mind is having when I think to the past and all that I\u2019ve lost and all that\u2019s been removed from my life that I held so dearly because of my selfishness and my addiction just makes me sick. I know right now I need to focus on what my future can bring by being sober and never touching this dream killer again and later come to terms with the past but damn it\u2019s hard. I don\u2019t wanna touch the stuff or see the stuff ever again and I\u2019ll never forgive myself for what I let do to me. But how can I begin to to see what good will come for saying I\u2019m done no more I will not let this drug suck me in? There is a lyric from a song that I keep sticking to give me strength.  \u201cThe change begins with one step. However small the first step is hardest of all.

Right now my hair is just completely wild and out of control, it looks horrible and ridiculous but I\u2019m so embarrassed that I can\u2019t get myself to go to a barber.

        "answer": "Okay, as a preface I apologize if I come off as, for a better term, structured but here is what I recommend: \r\n1) for the hair, put on a hat. If you don\u2019t feel like going to the barber rn and then don\u2019t. It\u2019s good to expose yourself to uncomfortable situations but you\u2019re too uncomfortable don\u2019t push yourself. I get a depression beard cuz it\u2019s just too much and that\u2019s okay. You\u2019re appearance should be for you first and foremost. \r\n2) for the therapist, check your insurance and see who is in network. Also see if you have any drug clinics in your area who do mental health; in my area a lot of them do, and in fact my councilor is out of a rehab center and they are great. \r\n3) once you find a therapist, see if they\u2019re willing to do telehealth. Since the pandemic providers are now more open to that and your ins should tell you also if they do it as well. Helps to have therapy in a place that makes you comfortable. \r\n4) don\u2019t fuck with your medications. If you were running out contact the hospital who prescribed them to see what they can recommend or do. As you experienced a sudden stop of those will make things a lot worse for you; conversely, taking too much isn\u2019t good either as, at least in my case, some meds can also be muscle relaxers and really mess with you. \r\n5) the doctors and therapists are paid by you to help you. It is their job. They went to school to help people. Let them help you. It will hurt, you may feel like it\u2019s bs or it\u2019s not for you but you have to stick with it, even though it hurts.\r\nAnd finally:\r\n6) do not stop talking. This is something that I\u2019ve grown to accept I need to do-keeping what your feeling is not healthy, and I\u2019m sure you have friends and family to help. If you don\u2019t, you reached out for help here which shows you want to get better so keep talking, work through it, and keep going.",

Primarily he uses cocaine but he has experimented with harder substances. He has good times and bad times, where he uses more (like multiple times a week) and reacts worse.\r\n\r\nDuring the bad times he is incredibly difficult to deal with, and he can be very mean. After a very bad recent episode I threatened to end our friendship over his out-of-control drug use for my own mental health, and he told me he would get clean. AFAIK he was clean for a few months, then he took cocaine again. He told me that his therapist has agreed that it's fine to do cocaine occasionally, as long as he doesn't do anything harder.\r\n\r\nMy question is: how often is actually reasonable? I understand that some people can do it occasionally without developing a critical issue, but I don't feel super confident in my friend's ability to self-regulate. As such, I want to set a clear boundary about how much cocaine use I can tolerate from him, something along the lines of \"if you do cocaine more frequently than X amount of times per X unit of time measurement then I'll have to re-evaluate our friendship.\" Is once per month reasonable? I'd feel more comfortable with maybe once every two or three months, but is that too restrictive? Or am I going about this totally wrong? I want to set a boundary, yes, but I also want it to be a limit that he can reasonably adhere to.\r\n\r\nSorry for the essay. Grateful for any advice.",

Okay backstory is my husband (been together nearly 7 years) is 26, was heavily addicted to pills from a very young age about 19, so maybe age 13/14 til 19. \r\nHe has a a few relapses that I caught since then, but to my knowledge nothing really in at least 3-4 years. He just uses thc pens regularly now. \r\n\r\nToday I got all 4 of my wisdom teeth removed and was prescribed 8 hydrocodone with i think acetaminophen.

        "answer": "First off, so sorry you\u2019re going through this. IRD incredibly painful to watch the ones we love do things that hurt us and themselves. \r\n\r\nA few thoughts I have\u2026 \r\n\r\n1. An addict has an addiction that stays with them forever regardless of if they get professional help or not. Professional help (therapist, 12 steps, SMART recovery, treatment program, sponsor, support network, etc) is to develop tools and new coping mechanisms with an aim to increase the likelihood of staying sober. The addiction will always be in the background, that\u2019s why guys with 20 years sober still say they got there \u201cone day at a time\u201d. \r\n\r\n2. Don\u2019t ask him, because he might deny it and that will make you crazy. Always trust your gut. Tell him you know and do not need to argue or prove you know. Do not give in or give room to negotiate what you know happened. Walk away if you have to and go silent and wait. \r\n\r\n3. Set boundaries, and make sure you are prepared to follow through. Anger or hurt feelings without boundaries does not inspire changed behavior. Boundaries without follow through erase your credibility. Consider things like \u201cI will not be in a relationship with an addict who is not pursuing recovery and following all treatment recommendations\u201d. Or \u201cgoing forward all narcotic medication will be going on a safe only I have the combination to\u201d.\r\n\r\n4. If he won\u2019t get help, you can for you, therapy, and alanon /naranon, etc are available for you to help you navigate. \r\n\r\nBest of luck OP.",

I\u2019m anxious all the time and I find myself bored out of my mind. Any tips for dealing with withdrawals and my constant urge to smoke when I\u2019m bored?",
        "answer": "Hi! I'm right there with you. Not only was I vaping  and doing edibles daily, I was also drinking nightly. One week ago today was my last dance with THC and alcohol. Don't get me wrong, I've been here before and relapsed, so I definitely don't have all the answers. This is what is working for me this time:\r\n\r\nI stopped on a Thursday night, white-knuckled it thru Friday, then spent all weekend feeling withdrawal. I was sick in bed, crying all the time, and stuffed my face with ice cream. But by Monday I felt MUCH better.\r\n\r\nI follow r/leaves. It is a great, supportive, and informative community for anyone thinking about or trying to quit THC. If you want to cut down, or take a break check out r/petioles (I hope I spelled that right).\r\n\r\nGood luck. It's a process.",

It has been tearing our family apart for some time now, and I require assistance on how I can do something about it. My father has it so bad that he choked my diabetic mother because she decided to drink tea instead of water last night. The stress has gotten me on edge and I hid all the knives in the house so he can't hurt anyone. He's been addicted to this and heaps of caffeine and whenever anyone talks about it to him, he gets irrationality angry. I am afraid for my life because I have no family and nowhere to go if he decides to do something atrocious. Please, for the love of god, please help. Thank you.",

The withdrawals can be severe I suppose but I guess he doesn't usually run out of it. The knives things shows that either you're a bit irrational about it, or that he's a really bad person in spite of the kratom.\r\n\r\nIf he wants to quit he could get on substitution with methadone or Suboxone, alongside with psychotherapy.",

        "question": "My Roommate Has Communicated With Me That He is Suicidal and it\u2019s Somewhat my Fault I started college in August of 2022. Since then, my roommate, that I was assigned randomly, has told me things about him being jealous of me for having friends, because he claims to have none, and that he constantly thinks about killing himself. \r\n\r\nI barely know him. We rarely talk, and he started telling me these things very early on. \r\n\r\nI have called the emergency hotline him and I even made direct contact with his mom about my concern about him. \r\n\r\nBut the thing is, I talk about it to my friends, and think it\u2019s a huge burden for me to carry, and that I shouldn\u2019t be the one responsible for getting him all this help and support. \r\n\r\nTonight, my friends said that it is none of my business to tell other people that he\u2019s suicidal, and they think it\u2019s rude for me to tell them his business. I say that I\u2019m near a stranger to him, and that it shouldn\u2019t be my responsibility to save his life, and they say that I\u2019m no stranger, I\u2019m his roommate. Meanwhile, I was just randomly selected by the university to live with him for a school year. Just because I\u2019m his roommate doesn\u2019t mean I necessarily know him or have a bond with him. \r\n\r\nSometimes I bring friends over to our dorm to stop by, and he tells them, people he\u2019s never met before, that he\u2019s suicidal and things along those lines. Those people are complete strangers to him, and I don\u2019t think they should have to bare responsibility for him either. I think it\u2019s something highly inappropriate to be telling us, because we are no therapists or other mental health professional.\r\n\r\nI think we are justified in telling other people because this is a huge thing to be telling a practical stranger, and we need to release our stresses in life, but my friends were saying he\u2019s coming to me because \u201che feels security with me and trusts me\u201d. But I feel this isn\u2019t the case because I barely know him, and he tells my friends that\u2019s just shortly stop by at our dorm. I shouldn\u2019t be the person to determine whether he live or die. \r\n\r\nMy friends tell me that my perspective is likely distorted because of my sister, whom is bipolar and severely mentally ill and suicidal. I say that doesn\u2019t have much to do with it, he should not be telling me and my friends about this stuff, and if he does, we are free to feel uncomfortable with it. \r\n\r\nThe thing that annoys me the most is that they don\u2019t live with him, so they don\u2019t understand the situation. They think I\u2019m in the wrong solely because his is suicidal, but I don\u2019t think I am because it\u2019s a huge burden to put on someone to tell them these things, especially if you barely know them, and that I have full right to tell other people what he is saying to me because it makes me uncomfortable. It honestly seems like a bit of a threat to me because now I don\u2019t feel comfortable bringing friends over. \r\n\r\nThe thing is, I am no mental health professional, I am a 19 year old college student trying to get a degree, I obviously have enough stresses, with him, he has added to these stresses and I have called people (emergency hotline and his mom) to help him. But somehow my friends think I\u2019m doing bad by telling other people my issues about feeling uncomfortable about it all. They think I should do more for him, but I feel as though I shouldn\u2019t have that responsibility.",

I am very lucky that my best friend and the love of my life has asked me to marry them. I've recently tentatively started looking at dresses online to see what style I might like but it's turned into a triggering nightmare due to the measurements and sizes. I'm in recovery and doing well generally but just can't imagine looking as beautiful as the models in these dresses at the size I am now. Really hate this disease for ruining what should be a joyful experience for me \ud83d\ude22",
        "answer": "When I was dress shopping for my wedding, I focused more on looking for something that fit my style. I knew dress shopping in person was going to be bad for me, I'd had horrible experiences with prom dress shopping and bridesmaid dress shopping for friends' weddings. I did not want to repeat that. (But that's me). So my mom and I shopped online for a style I loved, then had the dress I fell in love with made to my measurements. (I had her take them and send them in, so I never saw them). And I *loved* the way I looked in that dress. I felt amazing in it, even though I didn't look anything like the model. \r\n\r\nIf in store shopping would be less triggering for you, I'd suggest skipping online shopping and setting up an appointment with a place where you can tell them your style and they pick out dresses for you to try.\r\n\r\nOh, and be aware, for some awful reason, wedding dress sizes run small. So keep that in mind if they mention sizes! You are *not* bigger than you think. You have *not* suddenly gained a bunch of weight. The industry is just mean about sizing.",

Let\u2019s just say that \u201ccuriosity\u201d turned into something more. I couldn\u2019t get enough of this stuff. A \u201cSaturday night only\u201d thing turned into a weekend thing. Then, It turned into me smoking on school nights. From there, it\u2019s just gotten out of hand. Since 15, I\u2019ve taken 3 T breaks. That\u2019s it. With all this being said, I\u2019ve gotten myself stuck. Weed has ruined me. I used to be this fun, energetic kid filled with life and happiness. (It\u2019s kinda funny, I would always say to myself before all of this  \u201cwhy do people get sad? Just be happy\u201d). I found myself stoner friends that just encourage my weed addiction and vaping. I barely have any motivation anymore and the \u201canxiety of life,\u201d as they call it, is really getting to me. I\u2019m not happy with the person I\u2019ve become. Im scared for who I might become. I feel sluggish, brain dead, and unmotivated all the time. Weed has become me. And I feel if I keep staying on this road, it\u2019ll end me. Does anyone have any suggestions for quitting?",
        "answer": "That's tough, but the good news is that you're aware of it and looking for help. One suggestion I've heard from people who've successfully quit or reduced their weed use is finding alternative ways to manage stress and anxiety, whether that's through exercise, therapy, meditation, or anything else that works for you.\r  \r\n\r  \r\nAnother thing to consider is reaching out to a support group, like a 12-step program specifically for people trying to quit or reduce their weed consumption. They can provide a community of other people who are going through the same thing and offer accountability and support as you navigate this process.\r  \r\n\r  \r\nFinally, it might be worth trying some CBD products like [https://blondebud.com/product/cbd-cbg-tincture/](https://blondebud.com/product/cbd-cbg-tincture/) as a way to manage symptoms of anxiety or stress without the negative side effects of THC.

Before that, he was doing coke and ketamine quite often. Daily at some point. Eventually he opened up and told me he was struggling with addiction. It made me sad and I wanted to help. Fast forward to once we actually started dating. He claims he has been sober the entire time aside from two slip ups. One in august. One last weekend. I do not believe this at all and what makes it worse is that he becomes extremely defensive and angry when I tell him that. The reason I don\u2019t believe it is that for the entirety of our relationship, he is ALWAYS broke. No matter how much he works. For some background, I\u2019m the bread winner in our relationship and I pay all of the bills. He doesn\u2019t have to pay a thing. So for him to always be broke is very suspicious. His money basically disappears. Also, there are so many times where he\u2019ll be up all hours of the night into the early morning with the sniffles and ends up falling asleep with tissue in his nose. This is what led me to finding out he was doing coke last week. I looked around the room and within a minute of searching, found a coke straw in his empty cigarette box. Anyway, I do not believe that this was only one of two times he has slipped up since we got together. I\u2019ve just never really tried to bring it up even if I noticed signs. But I\u2019m getting upset about being lied to and I just want him to feel comfortable enough to be honest. What can I do?",
        "answer": "There is so much shame around addiction, it's difficult for him to be honest.  He's probably struggling with that. The only thing that would help him is unconditional love, that he feels secure that he won't be rejected for having this addiction. As long as he hides, he won't take responsability for his addiction. I say that as an addict in recovery that used to hide from my wife.   \r\nIf he can go beyond the shame, he may be able to look for help, therapy or support group, that's the only way out. You can show him the way by joining yourself an al-anon support groups, it's hard to deal on your own with an addicted partner. Have a look at /r/naranon/ too.",

The sooner you get off it the better in my opinion. What I've learnt at 41 after six years of sobriety \ud83c\udf89 is that habit, is the main driving force in most addictions and is able to be changed by acknowledgement and planning. Change what you do after work. I started by making my bed in the morning and when I did it I told myself this was a day of change, I didn't have to do anything more that day but with potential to do more. soon I was doing it more and more often. And then in those days I could try other things like doing press ups or making my lunch. Habits can be changed with courage and pesistance. Tackling booze and having AFD's alcohol free days is a great goal but first get used to being able to see your behavioural patterns and effect them with change.\r\nGive yourself time, being aware of your behaviour and then being able to effect it takes time and you need to find your own motivation to want to affect it.

It's so addictive and people ignore it because it's \"a prescription that's good for you!!!!1!1!!\" No. It's terrible and it's ruined countless lives. \r\n\r\nThat ability to feel pleasure comes back. It takes time, of course, but it's worth it in the long run. I'm learning more about myself and my capabilities that I never thought I could have/do without Adderall. Your brain will recover with sobriety. I won't act like the withdrawal is easy. It's NOT. But if you tough it out, it's get better and better everyday from the last time you took it. \r\n\r\nIf you haven't gone yet come to r/stopspeeding. We are all going through/went through the same battle you are. It was my saving grace for me to tell my doctor I was abusing it, now I don't EVER have access to stimulants and I don't regret it a bit. \r\n\r\nHang in there. You're not alone in this battle. I know how you feel and there is a light at the end of the dark tunnel. Stay strong.\r\n\r\nAlso! Not trying to be a creep but I saw you like periphery. They're my legit favorite band ever. Being off Adderall has made me love and appreciate their music so much more. I even got a tattoo of lyrics from sentient glow, I did post it on the subreddit too so if you wanna see it, it's there :)",

        "question": "I masturbate while smoking crack cocaine... I can't stop and may die. No one to talk to I've cut out all other drugs but I keep going back to crack and I use this while I masturbate. I feel like I have no one to talk to because it is an uncomfortable subject (I don't like to make others feel uncomfortable, but i can bear it myself) so I just keep relapsing. I have tried talking to my therapist but haven't gotten very far.\r\n\r\nI can go weeks or months sober but eventually a certain time I will masturbate (without drugs) and that will make me horny and crave the fun/pleasure to combine with crack and then I relapse.\r\n\r\nEverytime I smoke I panic that I'm going to have a heart attack and I think \"never again\" but once anxiety subsides I take another hit.\r\n\r\nThis isn't exactly something I would talk about in my AA meetings, or to friends or family. A professional or anonymous reddit seems my only choice. I attend AA meetings but it seems if I don't confess this specific issue it will keep happening.\r\n\r\nWhat are your thoughts or advice?\r\nThank you\r\n\r\nEDIT: Thank you so much everyone for the sympathy, advice, and relating. I didn't realize this was a common issue and I feel better about talking with people openly about my addiction now. The biggest thing I got out of this post was being able to talk about my issue and I hope to talk to people in person. Keeping this a secret for years has been greatly limiting my recovery.

        "answer": "I think you will find quite a lot of people use drugs , especially uppers ie : coke, crack, amphetamines, meth etc.\r\nTaking drugs and masturbating or sex with prostitutes and people is quite a normal combination.\r\n\r\nTalking about it is going to make you realise it\u2019s not as big as you think .

        "answer": "This might sound bizarre but it worked for me often. I have the same thing, I know when I've got that itch and it felt inevitable (it isnt). I started trying to remove the emotion aspect to it and view it simply in terms of my brain and habit. Your brain has created neural networks that lead you to use whatever substance or activity. You have feelings of sadness, you use, feeling of happiness, you use, until eventually your brain feels hardwired to always use. But it isn't. When you get those urges, try not to panic or get angry or shamed or anything, try viewing it as a signal being shot through your head. The more you use, the more often you'll get those signals. If you view them in that sense I found I had way more power to ignore. And first I'd give myself 10 minutes to ignore, and by then the signals had passed and I didn't want to anymore. the more you can do that, the stronger you make the neural pathway of \"craving --> stay sober\" . And it builds on itself until your brain redirects more and more easily. At first there will probably be times that you will still follow through with using because it's so habitual at that point, but you can see it as a brain malfunction and not shame yourself \r\n\r\n\r\nAnd I'm not saying you aren't hurting, and that it's simply a bad habit. There are reasons we get to that point, but it's a hell of a lot easier to deal with them when you aren't stuck in the cycle of fucking over your brain and body",

I can only cry when I'm too drunk to remember most of it, and the parts I do remember, I know it's a vicious cry - soaking face and clothes in my tears and snot kind of cry. But when I'm sober it feels like my emotions just keep boiling up inside me but never boil over. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPart if what keeps me attached to the alcohol is the ability to just get it out. To cry. To drunk text people the thoughts that have been eating me. I'm glad my drink of choice makes me Sappy because a lot of my drunk texts are just telling my friends how much I love them and how much I cherish their friendships. Stuff I can't bring myself to say sober. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBut then I carry the disgust of myself for repeating the habits of my parents who ruined my life. Alcoholic parents. Alcoholic son. Repeating history. The only difference between me and them is what I drink and the fact I don't hurt any kids because I don't have any. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOk so the main difference is that I get lovey when I'm like this and they left me with the need for lifelong therapy but I just hate that I feel like them. I hate that I cant even be mad about what they did because I *get* it. I know that tug and pull of looking at your bank account and all logic going out the window. I know the justifications you make to rationalize choosing booze over food. Im just lucky that i dont have kids.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI spent the rest of my money for the month on Alcohol because I just couldn't stand feeling empty anymore. I wanted to be angry, to be lovey, to cry... to feel something other than plain-ness. To have the courage to remind my friends that I love them. To not feel scared of letting the pain come out instead of it sitting inside me. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI just wish I could feel this sober. I can't handle how it feels to exist sober. I don't know if I want to try anymore. I was so determined. Going to NA. I have a counselor. I'm in the programs. I was doing the work. But I'm still using, still drinking because it's just far too much to survive without it. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMy head is a dark place that brews and brews until I find some kind of aid that helps the pot boil over and I don't know how to survive without the crutch.",
        "answer": "First of all, I\u2019m so sorry you\u2019re feeling this way. It sounds really painful and I relate to so much of it. \r\n\r\nI\u2019ve got 14 months clean and sober now and it\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve gotten past 90 days. I had almost exactly the same problem\u2026 I couldn\u2019t cry while sober and it felt so frustrating. I couldn\u2019t be lovey or show affection unless I had some drinks in me. I couldn\u2019t even thank someone or give a compliment. Definitely issues that stemmed back to a parent\u2019s alcoholism and irrational, erratic behavior. \r\n\r\nIt took me 6 months of being clean to actually be able to cry. But then, I swear, I started crying at almost anything\u2026 happy things, sad things, just feeling empathy for another person. I started being able to show people in my life that I was thankful for them. It was difficult but I felt like I needed to do it because I\u2019d always wanted to be able to show those people that I was grateful. \r\n\r\nI know it\u2019s excruciating, trust me, I do. But, somewhere along the way, you learned you weren\u2019t allowed to cry and now the only way you can is by ingesting a substance that takes down all your defenses \u2026but it\u2019s also ruining your life. If you stay off of it for long enough, you\u2019ll learn how to feel all those things naturally. It\u2019ll definitely feel awkward, but it\u2019ll be worth it to feel whole again without something that\u2019s leeching your finances, mental health, and relationships. \r\n\r\nAnd I don\u2019t know if this helps, but I don\u2019t really do 12-step. It didn\u2019t really work for me. I use a lot of principles from it and I may go again one day, but it\u2019s not how I got clean or got through my first year. \r\n\r\nGo check into a good rehab program and then find a good IOP program to do for a few months after that. (The rehab will definitely help you with that aftercare plan.) The friends I made in that program have been a really solid support for me these last 14 months. They say connection is the opposite of addiction, and i whole heartedly subscribe to that. \r\n\r\nI hope things get better for you. :)",

DBT \"TIPS\" skill have helped me a lot. most importantly, shame will not serve you moving forward, try to be kind to yourself and compassionately acknowledge your discomfort and pain. talk to other addicts and know you're not alone, and there is a way out. highly recommend SMART Recovery (CBT based) and Refuge Recovery (Buddhism based) for process addictions. Good luck, you got this :)",

        "question": "I have a drug problem I\u2019m not really sure why I decided to come in here, but I feel like I really have no other place to go. I am 22M studying finance/marketing in college. I was adopted when I was a baby and my parents are quite successful. My mother owns a company and my father comes from a very successful European family. They both attended prestigious schools and expect nothing less from me or my older sister. My older sister is a former  5-star athlete and amazing student who has started her own company and is doing masters program in Europe. My grandfather invented a pretty famous product and my father inherited the patent when he was 14 because my grandfather passed away. My father never had a good relationship with his family, aside from his mother. My grandmother was the most amazing person in the world, but that\u2019s a different story. My mother comes from a successful Midwest family and has 8 siblings and our extended family is around 200 people. I am the youngest member of my family and needless to say I have a lot of eyes and pressure on me to be successful. I decided to go straight to college after hs but never really went to class, partied a lot and basically got myself kicked out. My parents were so mad and I ended up moving out of their house, living on my own and working full time first the first time to pay for all of my own stuff. I grew up a privileged childhood and I know I have taken so much for granted and this has put a tremendous strain on my relationships with my family. Growing up my parents never really said no except when it came to drugs and partying. I was never allowed to go to parties until late in hs and I was drug tested throughout hs. This didn\u2019t really stop me too much and I was in trouble a lot junior year. The only thing that was rally stopping me was that I was playimg on a high level soccer team and was being recruited to play at some smaller school. Unfortunately I got hit with a bunch of injuries and that halted my plans for college soccer. When I finally went to school I played for fin but definitely focused on just having. Fun. During the year that I left school, I started smoking weed and drinking a lot. I was working a construction/sales job and was making pretty decent money considering my situation. As the money started rolling in I started getting into cocaine. I was able to hide a lot of my stuff from my parents but I started selling carts and weed and my parents saw my bank transactions and called me out. They told me if I stop and get my shit together and do some online classes they would pay for me to go back to school. So I chilled out a bit and kept my head down and went back to school. That was 3 years ago. I have always had a big social circle and that has been by design. Do this day I\u2019m still not sure what is actually wrong with me, maybe I\u2019m a psychopath or just insanely arrogant but I have a reason for absolutely everthing I do. I make sure to plan my interactions, I choose words and leave out details in order to get stuff out of people. And it works. I don\u2019t know why or how, but I grew up in a upper middle class white family and even though I am brown, I have somehow been granted some version of classism/privilege. My sister is really the only one I talk to about this but she made the note that I one across as always laid back even when the world is burning. We\u2019ll in order to stop me from losing my mind, i have started really just self medicating. I have so many issues with my body, mostly from sports and working construction, but now I know it\u2019s other things too. About 2 years ago I decided I wanted to work out and get back into shape. I started lifting like 10 times a week going 2x a day and just non stop work. I ended up hopping on sarms and it allowed me to push my body to new limits. I\u2019m the end I got hurt because I would use the sarms to numb my body and I would smoke and take preworkout to  push though the pain. I was doing an summer internship at an investment firm and so my and the other interns were always doing adderal, Ritalin, or something to keep us focused. I then started getting back into coke after meeting a mutual friend at a party that deals. We ended up striking up a deal and I could get him into parties and he could sell. After the first few parties I brought him to I got a different kind of high. The high of having power. I can get into that later but basically fast forward to when school starts and me and my friends are buying 8bas every weekend doing a g and then selling the rest at parties. I started moving so much product for my guy that he was giving me free stuff just cuz he knew I would move it. Around this time I started getting into shrooms. I used them as an escape/reset when I was in a bad mental place or just had a lot going on. I have had some amazing experiences and some truly horrifying experiences (i can share) but I started microdosing a lot and would mix it with weed and cocaine. I started getting some crazy trips which led me to Molly, popper, concerta to name a few. I still don\u2019t want to get into anything stronger and acid scares the shit out of me. But basically I am at the point in my life where I am unable to sleep unless I am on something. I hate being with my own thoughts and I have started disassociated from certain things. I almost feel like I can\u2019t distinguish what is real and what is me being high or just overthinking. I cannot tell my family for a variety of reasons. Of course it would kill them and it would mess everthing up. But the other reason is because I have never been doing better from the outside looking in. I am currently in the last rounds of interviews for some big private equity and wealth management firms. I am still dealing and making good money, I live in a party house which has only made me more popular and crave the attention more. But at the same time I feel like I\u2019m stuck in a time loop. Every week is the same. I constantly relive memories. I don\u2019t remember doing school work and yet I am doing good in my classes. I just find time to grind stuff out and I basically just live for the weekend. The reason I\u2019m writing this is because I know that I am so close to losing it. I am currently in love with my best friend and I don\u2019t know how to tell her, I know if I keep doing this amount of drugs I will die, I know that I can\u2019t keep putting on fake smiles and pretending to like people. I have always been able to smile and be nice to people but recently I have felt myself become really mad or annoyed at absolutely nothing. But I have so many people telling me how good I\u2019m doing and how proud they are of me going back to school and landing a good internship. So  im not sure if anyone will actually see this or spend the time reading it, but I\u2019m open to anything. And I have lowkey lived a pretty crazy life and have a bunch of stories I can share.",

I\u2019ve known him since I was 14 (I\u2019m 23 now, we started dating when I turned 21) and he\u2019s always been one of those kids who smoked weed all the time then eventually that turned into taking percocets & xanax. He got in a long-term relationship and had 2 beautiful kids and stopped taking them. Around the time we started dating COVID had hit and he lost his job and he started taking them again. At first I didn\u2019t know, I thought he was just a really sleepy guy (lol). I never knew the signs. At some point we broke up, no contact at all. I found out from a mutual friend that he overdosed and went to rehab. We got back together shortly after. He ended up doing a 4 month jail stint, related to his drug use, in October and when we would talk on the phone it was the most coherent i\u2019ve ever heard him. Everyone was so proud of him and kept reminding him to keep up the good work when he got home. He even converted to Islam which I know to be a peaceful and disciplined religion. He got released on Jan 29th and I just found out a few days ago that he\u2019s been taking xanax again almost every day for the past week. I don\u2019t know what to do, I\u2019ve never experienced this first-hand. I feel like I have to babysit him to make sure he doesn\u2019t take anymore and OD. He\u2019s on 3 year probation and facing 10 years if he violates. I reminded him that even though he hasn\u2019t started getting drug tested yet it could happen any time then he\u2019s going to feds. He says he\u2019s ashamed, he couldn\u2019t fight the temptation. I love him but I can\u2019t stop my life to babysit him. I know he has to want it for himself but I begged & pleaded with him to stop and he said he would. Sometimes I wish I never even found out, I wish he hid it better and I could be blissfully unaware of it. I\u2019ve never been in this situation before but I\u2019ve asked him if he\u2019d go to NA or therapy and he said no. What will it take for him to stop? I thought he already hit his bottom.

        "question": "Dating an Addict - How do I help? My boyfriend (30m) has been using a variety of drugs since his early teens, and has been to AA/NA & rehab before we started dating a year and a half ago. His primary drug of choice is coke & alcohol, and his come downs are awful. His mood swings are all over the place, and when he gets angry it\u2019s explosive. He\u2019s definitely paranoid. His energy when he\u2019s not using is pretty much non-existent. He\u2019ll go days without showering bc he\u2019s so tired, and can\u2019t be counted on for any apartment responsibilities. He just \u201cdoesn\u2019t care\u201d about almost anything. If he\u2019s not working he has no motivation for anything except partying.\r\n\r\nFrom what I know, and have seen, he uses at least weekly. And when he gets going it\u2019s never a bump or two, it\u2019s a full bottle of whiskey and as much coke as he can handle. When he\u2019s not doing coke he will drink an entire bottle just to fall asleep.\r\n\r\nI will partake sometimes but mostly I smoke weed and drink on the weekends. I\u2019ve told him I\u2019d quite everything if that would help. We\u2019ve talked about him taking a break but when it comes down to it, he\u2019s barely slowing down. Much more than when we started dating but it\u2019s still pretty constant. He tries to compare his coke use to my daily marijuana use, and \r\nknow drug use is drug use, but to me a hit mid workday or before bed is just different from him staying up for 24+ hours and then sleeping for 13 hours to recover. I\u2019m worried about it. I\u2019m worried about what this is doing to his body and his mind. It\u2019s not sustainable.\r\n\r\nI just don\u2019t know where to start. He usually throws my weeds use in my face and cuts off the conversation. If anyone has been in his position before what should I stop doing? What would have been helpful?",
        "answer": "You can support him when he decides to take Recovery seriously, that's about it.\r\n\r\nYou can't make him quit or make him want to be sober, it's entirely on him to do that. The best you can do is set healthy boundaries. \r\n\r\nFor example, if I had a night of drinking I wasn't allowed to handle my son for bath time. It wasn't a punishment or anything, just a boundary my wife set for our families safety. But then I had to make the choice to drink and not spend time with my son.\r\n\r\nLook up support groups for friends and families of addicts. I like SMART Recovery, personally. I hate to say it, but it is likely your BF will get worse before he gets better. You can't rely on hope that he'll spontaneously want to get sober and your relationship will improve. That is generally not how these situations turn out... You have to take care of yourself, you can't be a parent to a full grown man who is an addict.\r\n\r\nGood luck",

Recently she's been having moments of feeling terrible about the way she looks, usually preceded by a large dinner or meal, and occasionally will feel the need to purge. I know I shouldn't be an enabler but it doesn't happen daily or even weekly that I know of. But I'm worried about what I don't know or how to support her or what I can do to help. I don't have experience dating someone with an eating disorder and I feel clueless and helpless. Thank you for taking the time to help if you can.",
        "answer": "I\u2019m really sorry that this is happening. Is she open with you about her struggles with binging and purging? If she is, it might be good to try to talk to her (without being too pushy) about looking into therapy and/or medication. Prozac has changed my life recovering from my eating disorder, as my  emotions are generally a lot more regulated as opposed to skyrocketing between highs and lows, so I don\u2019t feel the urge to binge or purge like I used to.\r\n\r\nI used to think people were lying when they said EDs weren\u2019t about weight, but it\u2019s true. Whenever I traced back my ED episodes, it often began with stress from schools or sadness about other things, then I\u2019d start thinking about my weight and proceed to try to take control (and weirdly, get a dopamine hit) off binging and purging. I would try to be there for her, talk with her, distract her, whatever she wants to do when she\u2019s feeling those emotional lows- hopefully getting her mind far away enough from feeling an urge to binge and purge. But ultimately, no one can or should be held responsible for every second of someone\u2019s life, so know that it is not your fault if/when these episodes happen anyways.\r\n\r\nSort of a side note but I would avoid making comments about her body for the most part. Even well intended comments about looking healthy can send someone with an ED into a spiral (associating healthy with gaining weight, then feeling a need to compensate). And comments about looking slim can make people with EDs feel excited and make them think they should keep up what they are doing.\r\n\r\nI hope your girlfriend is willing to talk open up about these issues to you, and if she is, you should ask her what you can do to help her with this and encourage her to seek treatment again if need be. I\u2019m glad you\u2019re trying to help her, and I hope that you are easy on yourself as EDs are incredibly difficult to understand, and ultimately, you cannot make someone break those habits; they have to choose to.",

I also need a PCP, but I need psychiatric help sooner..\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI understand that my insurance website has a list of providers who accept my insurance, but I've looked, and there are over 100 options...how do you choose?\r\n\r\n\r\nETA: I'm not a threat to myself or anyone, my \"desperate need for psychiatric assistance\" is more so that I've finally decided to see a professional and hopefully find a medication that could help me get through my current mental health struggles. I don't need to be hospitalized, nor do I need any crisis care. Thank you \ud83d\ude4f",
        "answer": "Don't be embarrassed, it's not something that's advertised.\r\n\r\nThe easiest few ways are to either go through your insurance's website which will have a provider search. Search for psychiatrist and use filter settings to find someone close. Either call the associated number or see if they have a website and email them. Psychology.com and zodoc have similar searches but you'd have to manually select your insurance and it's not as perfect as the insurance websites. But I think those two sites allow you to schedule an appointment through the site. You can also just Google psychiatrist town name state name then look if they accept your insurance. Feel free to call a few and see who gets back to you first, but usually you get a feeling from their profile.",

I can't count how many times I've downloaded MyFitnessPal and thought \"with this I'll be able to finally control my eating\" only to delete it a week later because I binged the same night I got it and felt too ashamed to enter it into the app, let alone knowing how much I really ate.

This time last year I was healing, I was working out, my purging was at it's minimum in 4 years, I was eating healthy, I was eating enough. My mental health is at its lowest, my binging at its highest. Every time I try to heal, my brain goes \"Does it even matter?

        "question": "I am not okay I\u2019m a cocaine addict. I\u2019ve been addicted to it for over a year now, but honestly I\u2019ve been abusing any and every substance I\u2019ve ever come across since about 15-16 years old. This is just the hardest substance I\u2019ve become hooked on. \r\n\r\nThings got so bad over this last year (financially, health wise, mentally) that I had no choice, but to move back in with my parents. I\u2019ve been to rehab once before, but when I wanted to go again recently ( just before I moved in with my fam ) I couldn\u2019t find anyone to watch my big dog. He\u2019s a handful, a sweetheart, but just a lot to deal with. My mom is home most of the time, where as my dad is a trucker and is gone for a week or so at a time. With how my dog is there\u2019s just no way my mom could look after him on her own. So yeah, being broke, and not being able to go back to rehab, staying with them was really my only and best option. \r\n\r\nI\u2019ve been here a month, well a month tomorrow, and at first things were going great. I was able to stay clean for 4-5 days. Even though my mom and I have had a rough relationship through out most of my life she has been extremely supportive and understanding. Overall, my environment here with my family has been good, probably the best it\u2019s ever been since I was way younger. \r\n\r\nHowever, I started using again within the first week of being here, and I haven\u2019t told anyone in my family about it because I don\u2019t want to keep hurting them. I also am extremely grateful for everything they\u2019re doing for me right now, and I\u2019m just taking advantage of them by continuing to use when I\u2019m supposed to be getting sober. I don\u2019t even really understand why I keep choosing to do it. \r\n\r\nI\u2019ve only admitted this to my ex, who is still a really good friend of mine, but the constantly lying to my family is really eating me up inside. I don\u2019t know how to be honest with them about what I\u2019ve been doing, and because of that I keep using to avoid thinking about it or feeling all this guilt. \r\n\r\nI\u2019ve felt for awhile now that I\u2019m just not a very good person, because of the choices I make through out addiction. But I feel like I\u2019m getting worse and worse every day, to the point where I don\u2019t even know who I am anymore or how to start trying to be better. \r\n\r\nOne of the things that breaks my heart the most is that I know my mom either knows I\u2019m using still, or at least is noticing that something\u2019s not right with me. But she won\u2019t outright say it. Anytime she\u2019s called me out for it in the past I\u2019ve lashed out on her. I say awful things, put the blame on her or anything else besides me, or I just become completely defensive and end up leaving / cutting off communication with her. \r\n\r\nI feel so awful for doing this to her. And everyone else in my life. I\u2019ve lost and pushed away so many people in my life because I chose to keep using and what it\u2019s turned me into. \r\n\r\nTomorrow, I\u2019m supposed to be 1 month sober. I know that my moms going to praise me for it because it\u2019s been almost a year since I\u2019ve been a month sober (when I went to rehab). Most I\u2019ve been able to stay sober since then is just under 2 weeks. \r\n\r\nI don\u2019t really know the overall point of this ran, and I\u2019m sorry if this isn\u2019t the right place to post this. I just feel really lost right now, and I don\u2019t know how to get out of the mess I\u2019ve created.",
        "answer": "You aren't a bad person, you're choosing to do bad things. Things that are bad for you and those around you.\r\n\r\nYeah, you're in a mess and that is probably triggering your urges/cravings, which feeds further into bad choices, more messy life, more urges, etc.\r\n\r\nThis isn't unique to you. Every addict knows exactly where you are and what you're going through. You're never alone, no matter how much it feels that way.\r\n\r\nThe good news is that you can make different choices. You got yourself in this mess, and you can get yourself out.\r\n\r\nWe're only as sick as our secrets. You have to be honest with your mother. I suggest talking to a therapist about how to do that in a productive and safe way.\r\n\r\nThis is assuming you're ready to try to recovery. If you're not ready yet, you still might have more messes to deal with and things will likely get worse for you before they get better.\r\n\r\nYou aren't a bad person, and you need to be willing to forgive yourself. You deserve love and happiness. But it will take work and time to pry those things from the chemicals that are trying to take over your life.\r\n\r\nGood luck.",

Everytime I see my psychiatrist he always asks me how I'm doing and I always say I'm fine which is a lie. it's just I don't know how to open up and say I've been struggling emotionally. Basically here's what I want to say\r\n\r\nI don't feel like my depression is getting any better maybe a little bit in terms of taking care of myself more often but I still do struggle with taking care of my teeth that I've developed gingivitis.everyday I have to force myself to brush them. Im fatigued which I think is a side effect of my meds and I almost have no motivation. I still feel like life is pointless has no meaning I still have feelings of worthlessness. I'm emotionally overwhelmed and restless alot. I don't think my anxiety is improving. My sleeping is also not good I toss and turn a lot I don't sleep all the way through the night sometimes. I feel so disconnected I sometimes question reality and my existence I feel like I don't belong in this world. I've been struggling with passive ideations I experience emptiness everyday it feels like I'm going through the motions. I feel so hopeless I have moments of happiness for a while like if something makes me laugh or something but still feel somewhat depressed. I hate waking up in the morning the only thing I want to do is stay in bed all day and not deal with life. Sometimes I wish I could just sleep forever sometimes I think about killing myself but I don't have the courage to do it. if I had the courage to end my life I would. I feel so trapt in my mind. I feel like life is just too much for me. I feel like I'm existing for no reason. I feel like I can't be fixed.\r\n\r\nI don't know if that's to much to share because he's a psychiatrist and not really a therapist but I just need someone to know how I'm feeling and listen I want to be heard. \r\n\r\nSorry I don't know if that makes any sense.",

I just found something out that is weighing on me terribly out my dad. He (61M) recently had a massive stroke\u2014the majority of the damage was on his left brain. I\u2019m trying to stay hopeful about it but the doctors don\u2019t give me much hope. My dad was my families main provider, which consists of just me (24F), my mom (60F), and the dogs. I\u2019m trying to figure financials out right now and make sure we don\u2019t lose the house he worked his ass off for. My mom is beside herself so I\u2019m trying to do everything I can to help. This whole thing unraveled when I was trying to figure out where he rolled his 401k over to. He had changed jobs at the beginning of last year and I knew that this company didn\u2019t offer a 401k, so it had to have gone somewhere. \r\n\r\nI was scrolling through his bank statements and saw that he was withdrawing quite a bit of money at these two addresses that I ended up googling. Well, he was gambling again. It looked like he had started going to the two casinos nearby and playing FanDuel and what not in June of last year. When I was  younger, he had a really bad gambling addiction. To the point of almost losing everything. My parents almost separated but things worked out, we\u2019ve grown a lot as a family in the past ten years. He had worked so hard on himself to get better. He\u2019d gotten on some medication that really helped\u2014he has been severely depressed his entire life. I snooped too far into his phone and found that he downloaded BetterHelp in August of 2022. He was suicidal and looking for help with his gambling addiction. \r\n\r\nMy dad\u2019s addiction is something I hold a lot of guilt for because I know I should have talked to him about it. I\u2019m literally in graduate school, becoming a social worker. About a year or two ago, he and my mom had started going to casinos together again. They both knew I wasn\u2019t comfortable with the idea, I told them that he had an addiction like anything else\u2014you don\u2019t do them at all, not even in moderation. They didn\u2019t take it seriously. I know my mom didn\u2019t, even when I told her that I saw my dad playing an online casino game on his phone back in the beginning of January. She just said that he was making less with his new job\u2014I know see from his bank statement he was actually making more. I should\u2019ve confronted him. I wish I told him it was okay to talk to me, that I would\u2019ve helped him. There\u2019s so many things I wish I could go back and change :( \r\n\r\nI\u2019m afraid to tell my mom the extent of his addiction. I\u2019m also afraid to look further.

The Dealers dad is my working collegue (it was also way too much pressure to handle).\r\n\r\n16th my neighbour which i smoked weed with almost daily, confronted me about crashing her car which i have used and black drove with to buy more drugs in her absence.\r\n\r\n17th i told my dealers dad what happened. His son now isnt going home anymore. I dont know what he did, he's scared to go home. I am the reason for it. What i think happened is that he owes money to the wrong people to cover his costs.\r\n\r\n18th i had to tell a dear friend of mine how much my life went out of control. I almost drove him black somewhere if i wouldnt have crashed the car that day. Thank god i crashed it beacause i was full on drugs. Who knows what could have happened, if i had 4 others with me in the car.\r\n\r\nToday is 19th, sunday. 5th day that i am sober. Im craving for drugs. I dont even have the money to buy cigarettes beacause i spent everything on drugs. This entire night i couldnt sleep. I know cigarettes are also bad, but right now i truly truly need one to calm me down.",

I don't know why I am this way. I don't know anybody else who is such a crazy addict. It's my defing trait and everybody knows it. Anything I like I get addicted to it.i went to the strip club once than went two more times that month, I popped a pill last month and then went on a binge for weeks, I relapsed watching porn this week and watched it 4 times today, a girl showed some interest in me and I went home with her even though I'm in a relationship because I'm addicted to attention, she ended up being a total psycho and kinda traumatized me with certain behavior during sex. I'm even scared to actually ask you all for advice because improvement seems impossible. My grandfather, grandmother, mom, dad, uncle .. are all alcoholics and have allot of personality flaws. I feel like I'm the most aware of how toxic and bad the family is but I still can't break out. I started using when I was 14 or 15 and quickly went from weed to heroin( not a gateway drug my ass) I quit opiates and benzos a couple years ago but I relapse every 6 months or so.i moved out young which really enabled my addictions because I've been able to do whatever I want since I was 16/17. I pretty much forced my gf to break up with me by disappearing for days. Because she deserves better. She's actually great and if I was more mature I'd be gaurenteed to have a good future with her. She loves me and saw I was a straight a student and talented at my hobbies and jobs . But I am just so fucking messy and she can't handle it anymore. I do bad things but I know they are bad and they eat at me unlike other family members.ive fealt so icky all weekend since I cheated but I had allot of chances to stop.  I feel like now that I'm single I'm about to go down a really bad path. I have no self control at all and I'm scared to. I'm scared to live a life without all these constant vices and temptations.

        "question": "Are these valid reasons to report a mental hospital I recently stayed at? I just got out of the worst hospital known to man, which I will not be sharing its name, since I do not wish to stir up too much controversy in regards to it. I will however, say the terrible things I witnessed there, in my 6 day stay, and I want to get your alls opinion on whether or not this information is valid enough to submit a legal report on the staff.\r\n\r\nWORST OF IT\r\n\r\n-A troublesome 15 year old patient, let\u2019s say his name is James, was really pissed off, and he was having a really rough day, and was arguing with a staff member, let\u2019s calling him Joseph, the James said \u201cMan go die in a car crash.\u201d Joseph replied with, \u201cYour crazy dude.\u201d Then James replied. \u201cGo off yourself man.\u201d And then Joseph, THE NURSE, REPLIED. \u201cYOU go off yourself.\u201d\r\n\r\nThis enraged James and caused them to attack Joseph, quickly being subdued and strapped down and injected with a needle. \r\n\r\nAfter this, Joseph tried to silence me, and the other patients who witnessed it, saying. \u201cI didn\u2019t say anything, you guys saw us, you know that.\u201d And when someone spoke up saying the truth, that he did in fact tell the patient to kill themself, he began arguing with him. It ended with the staff saying they were going to \u201cinvestigate what happened.\u201d Even though he was still working there for the rest of the day, and the following day.\r\n\r\n-There was a kid with a mental disability, I sadly did not get to pinpoint it, but he had slurred, slow speech, and had trouble forming entire sentences, not that theres anything wrong with that. Let\u2019s call him Steven. He had a buddy there who we\u2019ll call Mark, Mark matters a lot in some of these stories.\r\n\r\nThere was a guy with green hair, well call him John, who was a nurse there, he actively ignored Steven, and oftentimes abused his power. John once actively was insulting Steven, reminding him of how he got there, upsetting Steven. Mark stood up for Steven, saying. \u201cWhat are you doing man, you can\u2019t say that.\u201d And as soon as that happened, John said \u201cYour barging in and arguing with staff, go to bed.\u201d And forced Mark to go to bed. And afterwards, I could still hear him bothering poor Steven from in my room.\r\n\r\n-Some of the staff would laugh and call Steven a \u201cBoxhead.\u201d Because of his head being moderately flat on the top. It made him feel horrible all the time, and he made that clear.\r\n\r\n-They had a \u201cQuiet Room\u201d or \u201cSafe room.\u201d Like all mental hospitals do, and when people are breaking down, even if they ask to go there, they oftentimes say no because they\u2019re \u201cIn there too much.\u201d And they just need to \u201cStick it out.\u201d\r\n\r\n-One day, one patient punched another in the face, all that happened was a stern talking to, and that was it. No serious repercussions, no joke, 5 hours later, I saw the staff playing cards with him, knowing what he did only a few hours prior. They were even joking about how he \u201cPopped them in the face.\u201d\r\n\r\n-One time, there was a female nurse, let\u2019s name her Jessica, and her and John were messing with Steven, saying he \u201cNeeded to go eat a salad.\u201d When Richard replied. \u201cThen I\u2019ll eat your salad.\u201d Not understanding how that sounds, they got him in trouble, even though he didn\u2019t understand what he said. Steven then asked him why what he said was wrong, and they said \u201cIt can be interpreted in different ways by different people.\u201d Even though he didn\u2019t mean it negatively, he literally meant he was going to eat a nonexistent salad she had.\r\n\r\n-My therapist was awful, she ignored me multiple times, I never got to have a one on one talk with her, not once, and worst thing she did was probably how when I was having a mental breakdown, she put her finger in my face and said. \u201cNot now, it\u2019s group time.\u201d All stern like. Legitimately having no sympathy.\r\n\r\nMODERATELY BAD.\r\n\r\n-Joseph would oftentimes call me and others \u201cFat\u201d saying we were \u201cSpoiled\u201d and \u201chave it easy.\u201d I am currently 240 pounds, 5\u20196. \r\n\r\n-Depending on how good you were, decided the quality of the food you get. 1-4 levels, I was always level 4, beginning to end, the best level, but I started off as everyone does at level 2, so I know how all the food works.\r\n\r\nIf you were level 4, you would get unheated chicken tenders, soggy hard fries, and a few other things such as corn or peas.\r\n\r\nIf you were level 1-3, you had to eat terrible stuff, examples being, A refrigerated packaged ham and cheese sandwich, a small fruit cup like the school lunch ones, and if your lucky, a banana, but only if they were nice and wanted to get up to get you one.\r\n\r\n-Probably the least important, but you had to raise your hand to get out of a seat, and you couldn\u2019t walk or pace, you always had to be sitting unless you needed water, or went to the bathroom. They\u2019re reason being \u201cWe don\u2019t know if you\u2019ll attack us.\u201d Even though the unit I was in was full of people who actually wanted help, and even the violent ones were respectful to them, case in point, the patient who punched another patient playing cards with the staff 5 hours later.\r\n\r\n-Lastly, you were not allowed to go into your room until nighttime, so you never got to have time to rest, they were always forcing you to be active and do group therapy, school, etc.\r\n\r\nI wanna get your alls opinions on this, and I will not be revealing any of the actual names nor the location, since I do not wish to cause too big of an upset",
        "answer": "Stuff like not being allowed in your rooms and that sorta thing, I assume different hospitals have different rules. I also assume this is in the US, and I live in Europe. That food hierarchy sounds very fishy. Usually hospitals should base their meals on nutrients and such. Again, highly questionable but not sure if this is unique to this hospital.\r\n\r\nBut just from reading the first point ABSOLUTELY YES. A nurse at a mental hospital (!!!) telling a patient to basically kill themselves is highly unprofessional. If the hospital doesn't actually take any action, that absolutely needs to be reported. The fact that he told you to be quiet means he knows he did something that could get him in trouble.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, I think staff (therapists included) treating patients unfairly isn't rare. I do think you should still report it. It is ultimately the reason why people often leave such facilities worse than when they entered.\r\n\r\nMy only concern is that no one is actually going to care about any reports made. But by reporting you did everything you could. And if it's possible, please do report this.",

I'm on autopilot at this point. i am high-functioning, with good grades in college. i feel so scared. just utterly terrified of people finding out, but i feel like this is a disease that i finally need to recognize that i have. since no one in my life can know, maybe if i post this i can get some sort of support so that i can feel not alone anymore.",

I tried to commit suicide last February but I called my best friend just before I passed out from taking about 20 zolpidem. My parents got an ambulance and to the emergency in time. \r\n\r\nIn the last 17 months I\u2019ve grown a lot, not because I really wanted to live or anything, I just got sick of feeling this way and thought, I\u2019m gonna give this one more big heave ho. \r\n\r\nI got better, I learnt things. Like, my depression is cyclical: no matter how much I improve it\u2019ll come back and kick me in the guts. So, sometimes I really just have to wait it out and cry and hide and do whatever it is to wait for it to pass. I learnt about more of my triggers, and I developed skills to cope. I spent money and time to sort out my migraines; I picked up crochet to have something to pour my feelings into. I developed tensodonytis from all the crocheting, and I spent more money and time fixing that, ending up with an expensive day surgery and I haven\u2019t been able to crochet since Nov/Dec 2020. \r\n\r\nI moved. Started to walk my dog every morning, taught my other dog how to pee in a tray coz he\u2019s too afraid to go out. \r\n\r\nToday, I\u2019ve been really depressed for 2 weeks and it\u2019s getting worse. The worse part is, my boyfriend is the one who triggered this round of depression, simply because he couldn\u2019t be kind to me. He told me to get my brain fixed so I\u2019d stop blaming him for all my problems. \r\n\r\nThe sad part is, he was also the one to push me past my breaking point when I tried to commit suicide the last time. He didn\u2019t come see me in the hospital. I was the one to reach out to him after I\u2019d been home a few days. We\u2019ve been together 3 years give or take. \r\n\r\nI want to believe in the good times we\u2019ve had together. The times when he smiles at me and everything is right in the world. When he confides in me and I lend him strength. And he tells me that he\u2019s IN love with me and that I\u2019m the love of his life. But I\u2019m too afraid to feels the good things because we usually end up in some fight or another soon after. \r\n\r\nI wonder if I\u2019m not kind enough to him. If I\u2019m the one pushing him to say these terrible things to me. I wonder if I\u2019m better off without him. But I know he struggles too and I help him through those times. \r\n\r\nI\u2019ve lost my train of thought at this time. I just want to be able to fight my fight with him being on my side. I want to be treated with kindness and respect and not hostility and impatience. \r\n\r\nThank you for reading to the end and I could really use some support right now. Be safe everyone.",

He\u2019s 7 years younger then me and just turned 12 which is around when my mental health severely turned for the worse. I think we have a lot of things stacked against our mental health both genetically and just environment we\u2019ve grown up in. \r\n\r\nOur mom died when he was 8 and I was 15 (she was sick for 4 years) and our dad is pretty fucking toxic. Living with him through quarantine had me so close to yeeting myself. At some point he decided me trying to take care of my brothers well-being was a threat to his authority but he barely steps in to take care of him so. He also basically isolated my brother from my moms side of the family (+his side lives far) and has yelled at me in the past for taking my brother to see my grandma.. he hasn\u2019t out right said it but I think he sees her as an enemy. Which sucks because growing up she was my best friend and my brother never really got to be close to her. I\u2019m not even close to my brother at all, even before I moved out last year, he fusses whenever someone interrupts him just being in his room alone on the computer and my dad would scream at me if I were to try to get him to do anything. And if I don\u2019t talk to him he won\u2019t talk to me for weeks Until something comes up I guess. \r\n\r\nAt this point I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m just like paranoid but I\u2019m scared of him falling down a dark path. I really don\u2019t know what to do to prevent?? Like were not even close so would I even know.

I left him. \r\n\r\nIt\u2019s surreal. For a month things seemed to be getting better. But I kept feeling like I was just waiting for the other shoe to drop. \r\n\r\nOn the last day, we had a great time. He stayed the previous night, we went on a lunch date and a movie. I enjoyed every minute of it. \r\n\r\nThen, we had to change our plans and go to his place. No problem. I was happy and I love his family. But his mood changed. I was having fun talking to his mom and playing with his niblings so I chose to ignore it. \r\n\r\nAfter he sent me home, we were squabbling over text. I don\u2019t think it matters what we were talking about but I think he felt cornered. And there it was: the other shoe. He turned nasty and told me I wasn\u2019t making any progress with my mental health. I argued that I was making progress, it just isn\u2019t the kind of \u201cprogress\u201d he wanted to see. \r\n\r\nHe said, and I paraphrase, \u201cyour doctors may lie to you, but I will never do that. You haven\u2019t made any progress.\u201d\r\n\r\nSo I ended it. But I had \u201cended it\u201d so many times that he didn\u2019t take it seriously. He texted me the next morning as usual. I told him that I could not give him the kind of progress he wanted and that I needed to go at it alone. \r\n\r\nI invited him to come see me in six months and judge for himself my progress, but for now, I\u2019m breaking up with him. And here\u2019s what hurt the most. He said he wouldn\u2019t be there. \r\n\r\nSo here I am. I have no appetite, I\u2019m smoking too much, I\u2019m depressed and my brain fog came back. Oh and the migraines. And I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019m having my period but I\u2019m spotting non stop. \r\n\r\nBut I also feel\u2026relived. Like a weight has been lifted. The constant anxiety is gone. But I\u2019m braced for the pain to come in waves. My two dogs are with me. And they\u2019re very concerned. \r\n\r\nSorry I\u2019ve rambled on for so long.

        "question": "My wife had another breakdown Some background, My wife had a full blown psychotic breakdown in 2018 that required hospitalization. The facility she was in bounced from diagnosis to diagnosis just throwing stuff to see what stuck. They eventually released her but she was not ready and was still very delusional. She had associated the stories of abuse from another person to herself, when there was no basis of it at all. She refused to go home with me but thankfully would go home with her mother. She then spent the next two weeks refusing to speak to me until her medicine began to work and her delusions subsided. She eventually came home and began therapy and we thought she had moved past the trauma that caused the break to begin with. Fast forward to now, she recently decided to try her hand at retail work believing she had her social anxiety under control enough for it to work. It didn't, she had a panic attack last Thursday and quit the job on Friday.  she only got about 10 hours of sleep in the next 72 hours. On Sunday I witnessed her doing something out of the ordinary on our ring camera and when I asked her what she was doing she looked like she didn't realize where she was. I had to leave work and calm her down. She began showing the exact same symptoms as the last time , racing thoughts, delusions, memory blackouts and general confusion. On Wednesday I had left her alone to go to school because she was at times mostly coherent. I had to leave early and help her calm down again. Yesterday on the advice of our primary care I took her to a different facility around an hour away and had her admitted. I'm by myself at my house as my parents are out of town. All I'm asking for is good thoughts, prayers to whatever God you belive in and just general support while she receives treatment and hope they can figure out the cause of this and help her with it.",

Now they keep coming back to haunt me in my intrusive thoughts. I don\u2019t know where to go from here ig and I just need some advice with healthy ways to start working through this and feeling ok until I talk to my therapist next week.",
        "answer": "First thing you gotta do is relax. Take a deep breath and look at things differently. These things do not define you and you should try to not let them bother you too much. \r\n\r\nThe fact that you have forgotten these things is proof of how much you've grown. So instead of thinking you're back to square one, try to let it go until you see you're therapist. Most importantly remember that you will be ok. \r\n\r\nEdit: im not saying to ignore these feelings but try not to let them over take you",

        "question": "URGENTLY need help please I feel like I\u2019m going insane Hi all! I\u2019m not sure if this is the right channel to put this in but I\u2019ve been struggling for a while.\r\n*note: this is not me seeking dx from anyone, I\u2019m currently already seeing a psychiatrist for depression and anxiety*\r\n\r\nSo for the past month I\u2019ve been on vacation and haven\u2019t been able to relax. I\u2019m leaving to go back home next week and I still don\u2019t feel satisfied enough. I have an appointment with my psychiatrist the day after I get back so I plan on bringing it up. For the last 1.5/2 ish months my brains been going all over the place. Since I\u2019ve been here I\u2019ve been planning my future from the next month until 5 years in advance. I live in America for example and I\u2019ve been going on for ages about how I\u2019m gonna move countries someday. \r\n\r\nI\u2019ve outlined a whole list of goals and everything about how I\u2019m going to get there (listed below) and have done extensive research on visas, university post graduate programs, current job openings, apartments, bus fare costs, plane tickets, etc. \r\n\r\nso here\u2019s what I\u2019ve outlined in my head for a while\r\n-firstly I\u2019m going to get a new job because my current one isn\u2019t too fun\r\n-secondly I\u2019m going to declare a major in international Justice\r\n-I\u2019m going to study abroad in wales (and possibly move there if I like it)\r\n-I\u2019m gonna graduate college cum laude/apply to the school I study abroad at for a postgrad program\r\nAnd so many more that are unrelated to this\r\n\r\nNow over the last couple of days/week or so, I feel like I\u2019m declining mentally again. I stopped taking my medication (Prozac) for a week since I\u2019ve been forgetting to take it, combined with the fact that I hate taking it. While on it and pondering my whirlwind of ideas I\u2019ve had really bad memory problems, trouble concentrating, staying off my phone, etc. it\u2019s worth noting that I\u2019m also diagnosed with ADHD so my symptoms may be exacerbated because of my medication. I started taking it a couple days ago since my mood was declining in the coming days before I started again. \r\n\r\nMy mood is getting progressively worse especially since I\u2019m going back home in a few days and starting school in the next 3 weeks. My sleep has been horrendous over the last few days and thinking about starting school again is making me really depressed. I had all these big plans only for me to completely lose interest in all of them and lose touch with where I\u2019m actually headed. I don\u2019t know what I wanna major in anymore and I don\u2019t know if I want to study abroad. \r\n\r\nI have a feeling I might\u2019ve just experienced a hypo manic episode and do plan on talking to my psychiatrist about it. But I\u2019m just becoming really depressed and impatient about other things which include finding an S/O. I feel like it could be the dating apps that I\u2019m on that are causing this and plan on deleting them soon but I wasn\u2019t like this for the last 4-6 months. There was a period in which I went from really depressed to content, then from content to the over planning and everything, to now feeling like I\u2019m getting back in a depressive state. I felt ready to conquer the world and set out on my journey but now I feel really lost again. I feel like I\u2019m going nuts and I could really use some support and advice on where to go from here. \r\n\r\nIdk how much talking to my psych alone is going to help and I feel like I\u2019m going crazy here. Thanks so much if you made it this far \ud83d\udc99\r\n\r\nTLDR: I feel like I\u2019ve experienced a hypomanic episode. I went from planning my far future ahead/feeling on top of the world to now feeling lost once again",

        "answer": "So many things could cause this; trauma, abuse, drugs, genetic disorders, chemical imbalance in your brain, mental disorders, etc. It sounds like you went through a lot of fucked up shit as a child, which permanently affects your brain. Your decision making, emotional regulation, and impulse control, among other things, could be outta wack. You're not selfish, honestly the problem might be that you distance yourself too much from emotions in general, and invalidating your own trauma leads to not caring about other's emotions. You're dealing with a lot of your own shit yet you're expected to act a certain way and put others first when you haven't even dealt with your own shit right now. This is honestly all just a guess though. You would have to go to a trained psychologist and therapist (not all of them are good and it might take a couple tries to find a good one), and really open up about all of this, and everything you went through, before you get some proper answers. Strangers on the internet aren't too helpful.",

I\u2019m feeling horribly alone and depressed about this.\r\n\r\nI finally got diagnosed in adulthood, and started learning coping skills and taking medication. \r\n\r\nI thought I had adhd since I was a teen. I was already in treatment for other mental health conditions, but every time I'd bring up adhd with a provider, I was dismissed without any further consideration (probably because I, and AFAB person, did not show the textbook male presentation of adhd / wasn't (externally) hyperactive). Instead, they chose to throw all kinds of anti-depressants, mood stabilizers, and anti-psychotics at my symptoms. Those medications never helped me. \r\n\r\nI grew up thinking I was just less than everyone else - that I was stupid, incapable, lazy, etc.. I watched people around me do everything I wanted to do and more while I fell short, and I never understood why. There's always been SO MUCH I wanted to do, but I didn't have the time management skills, nor the focus to learn and participate. \r\n\r\nAfter I started treating my adhd, I felt like I actually had some control. I didn't feel paralyzed and incapacitated by the simplest tasks. For the first time I was able to really explore my passions - I have always loved drawing, and in my late 20's I've finally. FINALLY. Been able to sit down and learn to draw. I love it so much, it makes me so happy. My art has helped my mental health immensely (although it scares me how hard it still is to draw when I'm unmedicated. And heck, how hard it is just to get through the day.)\r\n\r\nBut I don't know how to get over all the time I wasted not learning to do the things I wanted to, and now I'm years behind everyone else despite my best efforts. \r\n\r\nI don't know how to get over the fact that no one believed me when I was suffering. I feel genuinely traumatized by how dismissive they were, especially when I've come to find out how incredibly much adhd medications and coping skills have helped me.\r\n\r\nI know, I know... all I can do is move forward - there's no use being depressed about the past when you can't change it. (But, Good God, does it hurt.)\r\n\r\nAnd, even though I am more capable now that I'm properly being treated for adhd, I still struggle a lot day-to-day. \r\n\r\nEven trying as hard as I can, I just don't have the mental energy, time management, or executive functioning abilities I'd need to pursue all the things I want to do. I don't think I have an unreasonable amount of interests - I'd like to pursue my art more & maybe set up an online shop for prints or do commissions, learn to use a simple DJing app (a friend of mine hosts club nights, and I've always loved the idea of Djing), and of course I still have to work and keep up with the demands of my job (such as continuing education). I love yoga and meditation, and I'd love to explore fitness. Maybe read an occasional book.\r\n\r\nBut all of this on top of the basic demands of life - making appointments & plans, shopping and cooking for myself, being on time, getting to bed at a reasonable hour, and so on.\r\n\r\nI've already basically forgone the idea of ever getting back into singing or playing instruments like I used to, even though I loved it. I can barely fathom the idea of going out with friends, or even making more friends (I currently have only very few, almost none of them close.) I'm not even sure of how to execute the many artistic ideas I have.. \r\n\r\nI feel like I'm doomed to never be able to live up to my potential, because I have adhd. \r\n\r\nI'm doomed to always have to water down my dreams. \r\n\r\nI have to live the rest of my life watching myself underachieve.\r\n\r\nI have to live the rest of my life with the chronic stress and exhaustion of fighting my brain to get through each day.\r\n\r\nI'm stuck in this constant loop of mourning what I could've been; of trying to pick myself up out of the grief and depression this causes me. I'm tired and overwhelmed. \r\n\r\nI hope something, somehow gets better. I know I'll never get back the time I lost. But I hope I can somehow get better at managing.

        "question": "My friends said they \u201cneeded to talk to me about something serious\u201d I (22F) was doing an internship in another city for two months and I came back a couple of weeks ago. I have a close group of friends from college and we haven\u2019t had the chance to meet up until tonight. We would call each other rather frequently and everything was good. We are even talking about celebrating New Year\u2019s in Spain together. They want to meet up tonight and said they \u201cneeded to talk about \u00e0 few important things/something serious\u201d in person but won\u2019t tell me what it is and the tone of the conversation is really cold. I don\u2019t know what the conversation is about and even though they told me that there was nothing to worry about but I\u2019m really panicking at the moment and can\u2019t calm down. I seriously haven\u2019t done anything for them to be mad at me so far so I really don\u2019t know what is going on and the fact that \u201cit\u2019s something to talk about in person\u201d is making me go insane, I am overthinking every single thing I\u2019ve done. How can I calm myself down ?",
        "answer": "Hello!\r\n\r\nOK, let's focus on what you know.\r\n1. Your friends haven't cut you off, or stopped talking to you.\r\nThis suggests they still have positive feelings towards you and are still your friends. \r\n2. Your friends care about you.\r\nThey care enough to physically be with you when discussing something important. \r\n3. By your description, the subject of the conversation is going to likely be serious, but not directly connected to your actions.\r\nIf it was something you had done, they would probably have made reference to it, or you'd have an idea, eg \"we need to talk about the cake you threw into the lake last year\".\r\nThey care about you enough go talk to you in person about something serious, they may want your support and advice, because, again, you guys are still friends.\r\n\r\nIn this moment, you (presumably still) don't know what the conversation will be. I fully get the anxiety on that!\r\nSo let's focus on small things you have direct control over *right now*. How's your hair? Does it need a brush or washing? Do that. Take your time, do it carefully and gently. You have total agency of that.\r\nIs it lunchtime? You have full control and agency over that, given, I guess, time and fiscal constraints, so treat yourself if you can. Focus on what makes it so nice, textures, flavours, big portions, etc. Remember back to happy events around that food.\r\n\r\nAlso, I do something I call \"counting my blessings\" when I'm anxious. \r\nRight now, in this second, I am;\r\nWarm.\r\nIndoors in a nice house.\r\nIn a quiet place, feing safe.\r\nWell fed.\r\nLoved by my mum and dad\r\nTrying to help a stranger, and that makes me feel better.\r\nLater, I will;\r\nMeet my mum for tea.\r\nWork on my book.\r\nSleep in a soft bed.\r\nTalk to a friend about our shared hobby...\r\n\r\n...all nice, safe things, and I'm feeling more grounded and happy about myself now.\r\nIt can take a lot of practice and it doesn't always help, but sometimes it does.\r\n\r\n\r\nI'm sorry I wrote so much, but all the best for everything, and good luck going forward x",

Today, I overheard one of the friends in the chat talking to another saying \"He always overreacts about things, just let it fizzle down\" about my panic attack. I confronted her and she said I always overreact. I told her I was having a panic attack and said in the group chat that I was panicking and needed help. She said that a panic attack and panicking is not the same thing. True I didn't specifically say the words \"panic attack\" but I said I was panicking and needed help. No one even asked if I was OK. They just left me there after I said I needed help several times. The worst part was that part of the reason my panic attack started is because my friends call me childish nicknames and make fun of me, I'm afraid they think I'm annoying and don't like me.

I\u2019ve had my fair share of trauma and i was diagnosed with bpd at just age 16 and life has been pretty rough i won\u2019t lie. My depression rooms have been bad before, but never to this level. i\u2019m gonna be honest and open because i feel safe in the anonymity of reddit. \r\n\r\nAbout a year ago my mother spent a week cleaning my whole room of all its trash and it meant everything to me, i kept it clean for a good while but before i knew it it spiralled again (and i\u2019m holding a lot of guilt for ruining her hard work). \r\n\r\nFor months now i\u2019ve cried every night, i\u2019ve slept in the hallway when it gets too much, it\u2019s hard to even push my door open and i have to jump to get onto my bed.

The only space i have is one part of my bed for my body, it\u2019s so bad that the piles of crap on my floor are now taller than my bed. \r\n\r\nThis is so embarassing, i hate myself for it and all i want is a normal room. \r\n\r\n\r\nT/W : S*icide\r\n\r\n\r\nI won\u2019t go into detail, but last month i had an attempt. It\u2019s been one of many over the years, and it sprouted from hatred towards myself for living in this disgusting room. I don\u2019t let my family see inside, just my mother sometimes. She\u2019d love to help but she\u2019s sick, very sick.\r\n\r\nMy boyfriend doesn\u2019t even know how bad it is, he just knows its bad (mainly because he hasn\u2019t slept over in a year and i\u2019m always at his house instead)\r\n\r\nMy reason for this post is, for once i have the motivation to get it together but i just don\u2019t know where to start.

I get bed can be full.but to be let down and traumatized, I really can't handle that. I need more help than when I first asked it, already having terrible PTSD. Anyway to ensure a better chance of being admitted and ENTERING the facility you go to rather than being sent far away to a terrible place? Call ahead if they have beds?

        "answer": "Unfortunately, there is no way you can be guaranteed admission to a particular hospital. Mental health beds are few and far between in the US. Even if the hospital has open beds they may reserved for a particular class of patient. Review teams have a great deal of latitude on who they admit to their unit and may exclude people for various reasons. If you do call they probably will not tell you if they have open beds. There is no particular time of week or day behavior health facilities are slow or busy.

        "question": "This is why even the simplest tasks take up so much energy when you're mentally ill! So as someone who is depressed, basic hygiene, eating and self care are quite difficult for me. I know this is the case with so many other people, so I came up with a way to look at it from a different perspective! \r\n\r\nThink of any daily task, I'll use taking a shower as an example here! So for people who have the mental and physical energy to do stuff, who maybe arn't depressed, will see this as one simple task! Just showering, and while you're at it, might as well brush your teeth too! Now at least for me, that same \"simple\" task is divided into multiple tasks that have to be done after each other! \r\n\r\nMaybe something like this?: \r\n1. Find clean clothes\r\n2. Walk to bathroom where the shower is \r\n3. Take off clothes, jewelry and do additional preparing tasks\r\n      - Put dirdy clothes in the laundry bin/ washer\r\n      - wash your face\r\n4. Comb/ Brush hair\r\n5. Get into the shower \r\n6. Wash your hair with shampoo\r\n     - Apply shampoo\r\n     - Rinse shampoo\r\n7. Use conditioner\r\n     - Apply conditioner\r\n     - Rinse conditioner \r\n8. Wash body \r\n9. Rinse everything \r\n10. Get out of shower and find a towel\r\n11. Dry yourself with the towel\r\n      - Dry your body\r\n      - Dry your hair (add hair products if needed)\r\n12. Put on clean clothes \r\n13. Dry the bathroom floor\r\n14. Exit the bathroom, first making sure everything was put back into it's place\r\n- YOU'RE DONE -\r\n\r\nThat's ~14 tasks for us versus the one single task that mentally well people do! Think about each individual task taking up as much energy as it would take for a mentally well person to do the whole task! For different people it does vary what these individual tasks are, what order they're in and how many there are, but this demonstrates the overall consept! \r\n\r\nNow think about having to brush your teeth too \"while you're at it!\" 1. Gather the mental energy to do the task 2. go to bathroom if not already there 3. find toothbrush 4. find toothpaste 5. Wet toothbrush 6. Put toothpaste on toothbrush 7. Brush approximately 32 teeth! all sides! Every single one! 8. Rinse mouth with water (when done) 9. Wash toothbrush 10. Put toothbrush and toothpaste back to where they belong! \r\nYea.. This is also pretty much what it's like to do a task as someone who has ADHD... This is way harder than it should be and you might not be able to change that!

        "question": "Is there anything that lowers emotional intensity? My body doesn\u2019t know how to feel properly. Good emotions are fleeting which yeah is also a problem but any negative emotion is felt at a 10/10 regardless of the cause. If I stub my toe or get in an argument or don\u2019t have a place to put whatever is in my hands down my brain goes crazy. Any perceived \u201cnegative\u201d whether or not it affects me I snap. My day is ruined I\u2019ll panic I\u2019ll hurt myself and I can\u2019t calm myself down. I know it\u2019s normal to feel bad sometimes but everything is to the extreme my perception of reality distorts every feeling into life or death. Can this be helped? will I have to cope forever? Do I need to be sedated all the time so I can\u2019t get that intense? Is there anything that makes existence less intense?",
        "answer": "Do you mean pharmacological or behavioral.\r\n\r\nLiterally every mood stabilizer and neuroleptic/antipsychotic drug reduces emotional intensity\u2014lithium, lamotrigine, seroquel, oxycarbozepine, and to some extent antidepressants, although to a much less extent, hence why bipolar ppl or ppl with PTSD or borderline personality syndrome aren\u2019t stable in A/D\u2019s alone. You might say that anxiolytic drugs reduce emotional intensity as well (e.g. clonazapam is used to treat mania or relapses to mania).\r\n\r\nMany of the anxiolytics are essentially sedatives or tranquilizers (alprazolam, diazepam), but there\u2019s a ton of atypical ones that are used off label that are not hugely sedating\u2014clonidine and guanfacine to list a few. Some of the tranquilizers (generally benzodiazepines since older ones like the barbiturates are even more dangerous) are not hugely sedating but will always have some sedating effect since they work to increase gamma-aminobutyric acid, the main inhibitory neurotransmitter in your brain. Alcohol also does this and it\u2019s why it reduces social anxiety but please do not go down that path.\r\n\r\nNeuro-Behaviorally it would be along the lines of meditation, breathing exercises, cognitive behavioral therapy (depends to what extent your weddedness to certain fixed beliefs is emotional for you), and other whole body oriented with mindfulness component practices such as martial arts, yoga, and tai chi.\r\n\r\nI would also suggest that a structured writing practice can diffuse the triggers that nudge you towards excessive emotional intensity. I think this is a part of dialectical behavioral therapy which was invented to treat a borderline personality, a condition notorious for erratic emotional fluctuations of high intensity.\r\n\r\nI personally use all of these strategies. Pharmacologically I take lithium and clonazapam, methylphenidate and bupropion, but it\u2019s questionable how much the latter two address emotional instability and intensity.  In theory methylphenidate (aka Ritalin) *should* but at the same stimulants can induce emotional instability.\r\n\r\nI follow a structured writing practice that is pragmatically oriented that I use to defang the weight or severity of life situations triggers etc. All that said I still suffer severe fluctuations towards very intensive negative emotions involving rage and suicideality. I actually requested due to this fact because I know where it leads to otherwise.\r\n\r\nI am in a life situation (2 years foreclosure) that is highly triggering to me and I think the stimulant and antidepressant I use can feed into unstable emotions (methylphenidate/ bupropion). At the same time My blood pressure is pretty high probably due to circumstantial and possibly pharmacological factors (both the Ritalin and the welbutrin can increases blood pressure) so am looking to initiate guanfacine or clonidine to replace them. \r\n\r\nI was given a single clonidine pill in the doctors office because my blood pressure was critically high and I have never felt calmer in my recent memory.\r\n\r\nIn any case I hope this helps and I wish you all the best. It is a day to day struggle. There are no silver bullets no magical therapies or gurus that have a simple solution for emotional regulation.",

        "answer": "Depression is and can be a debilitating disease and qualifies as a disability. It's a disease of the brain, a trauma or traumas. Part of what makes mental health so difficult is people don't feel like it's serious. Would you look at someone who is quadriplegic and say you don't think the injury to their spine is not a good excuse for not taking a walk? Or someone who has an intense fear of heights not an excuse to not become a utility lineman? Or had he lost his sight, \"How come you can't read your own menu?\"\r\n\r\nI'm not saying people never take advantage of it as laziness and depression can look similar to people. But that people *often* assume laziness or downplay the impacts of depression and anxiety. Mental health sufferers get a ton of ableism.\r\n\r\nAnd yeah there are days I struggle to even get up to take a piss. They're rare but they happen. \r\n\r\nOur brains are hurt and how that manifests is a spectrum. Hope he can find a therapist and medication combo that will at least get him to functional.  Its hard and some traumas never heal. I've had depression all my life to one degree or another.\r\n\r\nIf he enjoys reading you could try getting him a copy of *The Cure for Darkness*, it goes into a lot of science about depression and how it's treated both in terms of medically/psych but also by the wider community.",

        "question": "16M Groomed online causing what I believe is a porn addiction Basically, at the start of the year I was groomed by a female in her 20s, guilt tripped me by talking about suicide in her past and how she was groomed when she was my age and how it was the best thing to happen to her. \r\n\r\nAll ready having low self esteem, high stress and anxiety levels I obviously was taken advantage of as I really thought she was someone who could help me, even though she never really gave a shit about what was going on with me\r\n\r\nI feel bad for not sending some of the pictures she requested as if it's all my fault and we'd both be happy and still talking like we used to if I had just listened. I know it's wrong but I miss her even though I know she didn't fucking care about me and only wanted me for one thing, every single day I keep thinking of her and things just keep getting worse. It's always me who causes the problems if I were to just fucking listen to her id be happy but of course i fucked up and she really made sure i knew that. I really need help on this situation it's unhealthy and has taken over me.\r\n\r\nHonestly I just really don't know what the fuck to do, I find that anything I'm not occupied I'm on porn now, it'll be like 2am and if I have my phone near me I'll watch it, sometimes even if I am occupied. And I can't stop thinking about her I really can't it's taken over me I really need help but I cant get it\r\n\r\nNone of my friends give a shit about it and one of the ones I told made a joke about it so really I don't think anybody fucking cares. If I tell ny parents, they'll get pissed off at me or something, I don't really know what they'd do and I don't want to find out. \r\n\r\nI want to speak to somebody but I am way too anxious and struggle with speaking to people about this in person, let alone my other issues.\r\n\r\nIf someone could message me with some advice or to talk about it that would be great, because online services like kids help line really aren't helpful, during a talk I just started cutting because she was that terrible. \r\n\r\nThanks again to anybody who's reading this, Lucas.",
        "answer": "Hi Lucas, I'm so sorry this happened. I was groomed by someone (he claimed to be just one year older than me but in reality I have no idea who he was) when I was 18 and very vulnerable and nieve. It went on for 4 months with him asking for explicit photos and me giving in. He controlled me for a whole summer. It messed up my relationship to sex for a good year or more and some really horrible things happened due to that. I'm sorry I can't help you when it comes to porn stuff as that's never been an issue for me but I know it feels when it comes to speaking out about being taken advantage of. It took me 2 years to tell anyone and I eventually told my therapist. I'm here if you want to talk.",

        "question": "My girlfriend is triggering my ED Hey Reddit,\r\n\r\nSo my (F) girlfriend (F) is a very naturally slim and tall, beautiful woman. She experienced a significant loss in her family a few months back and she\u2019s lost a LOT of weight from it. I want to be supportive, so I\u2019ve listened to her talk about her weight loss and how it feels and just generally vent about it, but it\u2019s the holidays and I\u2019ve put on a little weight because of it. She knows I struggle with disordered thinking, but I don\u2019t think she realizes how bad it is.\r\n\r\nLast night she whipped out the scale and she and her brother in law were weighing themselves in the kitchen while I was trying to eat pizza. As soon as they busted the scale out I dropped my pizza slice in the box and booked it to my bedroom until I could hear that they were done. As SOON as I come back out my girlfriend announces to me that she just weighed herself and she\u2019s unhealthy. I ignored her entirely until someone else changed the subject. I now have no desire to eat after months of feeling normal again.\r\n\r\nAnyone have any advice on how I can both support her in her time of need while also taking care of my mental health? I don\u2019t want to start restricting again but I\u2019m reaching the point where I can\u2019t help it.\r\n\r\nThank you guys",
        "answer": "Damn dude I don\u2019t have advice but that fucking sucks. \r\n\r\nThe one thing that might help you to consider is that it sounds to me like she is bringing it up so much - especially the fact that she\u2019s unhealthy - because she wants you to care about it. Idk how this sounds, because going about it this way isn\u2019t cool on her end (and this might not even be your concern) but if she does just want you to care, she clearly values the care you give her and sees you as someone who\u2019s attention she desires as she struggles. \r\n\r\nLike I know this might not change anything, but I don\u2019t think she\u2019s losing weight and feeling better than you or something. She clearly wants you to know she\u2019s unhealthy and to react by giving her attention. I don\u2019t mean that in an accusatory way, she probably needs it for real. But that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s easy or fair to feel like you have to respond with concern all the time for your partner to be ok. \r\n\r\nBut ultimately I don\u2019t think she\u2019s necessarily trying to compete with you or make you feel shitty about yourself, so much as get your attention because she feels inferior in your presence. She\u2019s probably far more wrapped up in her own perspective, which sounds pretty insecure rn tbh.\r\n\r\nEdit: I also want to be clear that I don\u2019t think it\u2019s insensitive of you in anyway to be triggered by your girlfriends behavior. If I were in your shoes I would also be super triggered and it\u2019s so kind of you to be asking how to support her. Remember it\u2019s ok to tell her what you need too. Her mental health is important but yours is too. I\u2019m just so sorry you\u2019re going through this and you can\u2019t find support from your girlfriend directly rn. I really hope that changes for you soon.",

        "question": "Issues with compulsive lying, need help with finding the correct treatment I have had problems with lying since I was in elementary school. It started as a way to get out of trouble, prolong any punishment my parents might dish out, stuff like that. It then turned it white lies and stupid things I would say in High School to make myself sound cooler. \r\n\r\nIm 21 now, and I just ruined a relationship with a girl that I was building for a while because of my lying. She cared about me, and knew I needed help, and pushed me to get it. It turned into me telling her that I had actually gone to a doctor and gotten medication, when i had not. She found out in October, and hasnt spoken to me since. \r\n\r\nI dont want to be doing this, its hurting me. Ive lost jobs, ruined relationships, and I dont think I can succeed in life if I dont solve this. What do I do? \r\n\r\nMy parents are willing to help me and ask what I want to do, but I genuinely dont know. They recommend inpatient therapy, and now we are researching it. Its not something that I want to do, but I think it might be good in the long run. I currently dont have a job and dont go to school, but I want to start a career as an electrician because trades are a great career. Should I do the inpatient therapy, then start that path, or can I do both at the same time. \r\n\r\nThanks for all the help",
        "answer": "\"Compulsive\" lying is a maladaptive coping skill people learn, not a mental disorder. People lie like this when they're taught as kids that telling the truth isn't safe and won't get them what they want, or will get them taken advantage of or hurt. Especially when there are narcissists around. And the second factor is when kids are \"seen and not heard\" and never taught to self-advocate or assert themselves.\r\n\r\nInstead of trying to \"fix the lying\" fix the reasons. Practice assertiveness, asking for what you want, maintaining boundaries, saying NO, and negotiating when faced with people asking you to do things you don't want to do or not giving you what you want. These are SKILLS that you can learn that are effective replacements for these kinds of lies.\r\n\r\nIn my opinion; going to a psych prison where you're going to have NO control, don't get to say no to anything, and don't get to ask for what you want is only going to reinforce the negative beliefs that make you feel like you have to lie. There is likewise no benefit to medication for this problem. Both of these suggestions strike me as \"you're broken so go do the thing I saw on TV and get fixed for my comfort\" rather than \"research.\"\r\n\r\nOne boundary I would start to set- stop letting your healthcare decisions be a \"we.\" **You** decide what treatment, therapy etc to pursue, and with who, and how, and when. When other people stick their nose across that line- Listen to what they have to say if you respect their opinion, and then tell them \"No.\" Even if you think they're doing it because they care, how it makes you feel shows through when you lie to evade it.",

        "answer": "Sorry in advance, this is long\r\n\r\nThere are a few things that come to mind, and please keep in mind that I am in no position to asses or diagnose anything. You should make an appointment with a mental health professional when you can, to discuss these things and look into further options. I know you said that\u2019s not an option right now, but it\u2019s worth noting there are some things that only they can help with (especially regarding medications and such). If you\u2019re not sure where to go, talk with your GP/PCP about wanting to get established with therapy or something along those lines. If you feel comfortable going into detail with that person though, some practitioners can prescribe medications for mental health as well\r\n\r\nWith that in mind, there are a couple things that come to mind. First, regarding the subject of those actions, it might be worth looking into your current diet and making sure you\u2019re not deficient in any vitamins. Vitamin deficiencies can create unusual cravings and unexpected behavior changes. If so, diet is the best way to get those vitamins, but supplements can also be used (just don\u2019t take more than the recommended amount, because you can overdose on vitamins as well). You can also talk to your doctor in the future about blood testing (metabolic panel) to determine more definitively where you\u2019re at with those things as well\r\n\r\nThe other things that come to mind are more mental health focused. But not in a \u201cit\u2019s all in your head\u201d way, rather, in a \u201cthese might be specific challenges you\u2019re facing\u201d way. Very broadly speaking, it sounds like you may be dealing with compulsions (\u201cdo this thing or something bad will happen\u201d), especially given that you find it near impossible to control them. I don\u2019t know about these, so I don\u2019t want to speak where I lack information, but it may be worth looking into more on your own, or with a professional \r\n\r\nThe other thing that could be a factor (again, not a professional and I can\u2019t say with certainty) is some level of dissociation. Dissociation is a disconnect between various aspects in experiences. This can include thoughts, emotions, memory, and even disconnecting from your own body or the world around you (depersonalization/derealization respectively). That \u201cwatching yourself do things from the back seat\u201d feeling is one I\u2019m very familiar with, having a dissociative disorder myself. Dissociation isn\u2019t always disordered though, I should note. Everyone dissociates some in their lives. If you\u2019ve ever read the same paragraph over a few times without understanding it, or forgotten the car ride home, those are examples of non-harmful dissociation \r\n\r\nBecause what you\u2019re describing sound like it is distressing and impacting your life negatively, it isn\u2019t my first thought that it\u2019s a normal level of dissociation. However, that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s disordered either. If you deal with a lot of stress or anxiety (which can also be tied to compulsions), that may be a factor, especially if you\u2019ve been dealing with that more recently before these experiences. This is also true if you have a history of prolonged stress or trauma, or if emotions are difficult to handle. Dissociation is a common coping skill for those things\r\n\r\nAll of this is to say that these can be normal experiences. Not necessarily average or common, but completely understandable and a normal human experience in the right circumstances. You\u2019re not alone. Even if there are different causes, you\u2019re not \u201ccrazy\u201d (few people who worry about being crazy actually are)\r\n\r\nIf you look into these things on your own, you may come across things like Obsessive Compulsive Disorder, or Dissociative Identity Disorder. This does NOT mean you have these things, just that there\u2019s symptom overlap. But just as I\u2019d sooner assume a sneeze is a cold and not cancer (even if that\u2019s a distinct possibility), I wouldn\u2019t jump the gun on all of the possibilities\r\n\r\nFor now, the strongest recommendation I can give is to focus on managing stress (try looking up grounding techniques), see if your diet is lacking in anything, and keep a log/journal about these experiences, especially as they do (or don\u2019t) relate to changes stress or anxiety. This way, you have documentation for yourself, but also to show any professionals if you take the step of setting appointments. It can help to identify patterns or triggers, and how to more forward from there\r\n\r\nBest of luck, and my DMs are always open if you need to talk",

Original post was posted in r/dissociation. It didn't get many responses so im just looking for more honest opinions. Responses told me they might be a little biasd so i went here to a sub thats more general in mental illness i guess. Im not looking for diagnosis. Just advice and opinions. That's all)\r\n\r\nOver quite a period of time, I've been experiencing a range of symptoms that I find to be concerning and very scary. It really stresses me out and I don't know what else may be explaining all of my experiences so Idk I guess I just need opinions on if I'm being dramatic or sensitive or something about all of this. Or if it actually sounds serious to you. \r\n\r\nSo I'll just jump into everything that's happened and I'll try to make this organized. This will be lengthy though. \r\n\r\nThe blackouts: \r\n\r\nI've been having quite a few blackouts lately. They're all always unexpected and I never am aware of them until family members tell me and I'll just be so confused out of my life. They would blame me for doing something that I don't remember doing AT ALL and it'll always be something that I'll never do too. Like just never because it's absolutely nothing like me. But they all apparently saw me doing it and there have been evidence of it. And it'll just be so scary because it happens just randomly and I won't even notice it. I think so far I've had 4 blackouts, over a period of couple of months. Some of them happened really close to each other's times. One more recent. \r\n\r\nI could go into details about the blackouts but if I did then it'll be WAY WAY TOO LONGG and this is already gonna be long enough. I would say that I do suspect that I've missed a very important family event because of it. And someone had took over by maybe a couple of days because when I came back so much stuff was happening that I had no clue about and one of them even involved me which just confused me so much on what I've actually might've missed. The last thing I remember was just putting my stuff in my bag so I could leave and then just instant blackness. No idea what the Frick happened at all or what my sister was talking about or whatever. \r\n\r\nThere was also another blackout where I went to our presumed \"inner world\" and I saw the voices faces and their houses and their powers. That I didn't knew that they had. So if those things help then that's all I'll say. One of them people there who was a witch told everyone there that I wasn't allowed back in there anymore so I stopped going to that place after that blackout. \r\n\r\nWeird identity changes:\r\n\r\nThere have been some times where i would start to feel like an entirely different person. Or feel like I don't even know who I am and then I would just panic and deeply stress about it. I would do things that I would NEVER do like ever. And it'll be unreasonable honestly why i would just suddenly feel like that or think like that. Some of the things I'm just absolutely incapable of doing too like skill wise and knowledge wise. \r\n\r\nThe most recent time this happened was with painting. Now I am a good artist, i very much recongize that. But my drawing has kinda gotten worse. I can't draw realism all that well anymore and I have a very very hard time drawing heads. Nowadays I just paint acrylics and use whatever I have left of my drawing skill. There was this one time where I was painting and I was panicking over a mistake I did. I desperately tried to fix it so badly and I just did anything I could. When I started panicking though, I heard a voice in my head that just told me what to do to fix it. And then I even felt myself moving on its own, painting on its own. Painting completely differently than I do in terms of style and brush strokes. They were extremely precise and used brush techniques that I don't even know. What they did really actually improved my painting a lot and practically saved it. This voice had also forced me to just stop painting because they told me that I was painting in the same area for too long. Which I indeed was. I just needed someone to force me to just relax. \r\n\r\nThis happened again like four days ago or so. Like i said, I can't draw heads well and have a hard time sketching out the figures. But that time I just weirdly felt confident and I knew exactly what to do. I knew how to capture the figure and how to accurately draw each line. I felt just suddenly influenced with this knowledge. And when the feeling had gone away and I had tried again to sketch. It went absolutely terribly. I completely just gave up on it then. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe voices:\r\n\r\nI've mentioned them in the last section but I'm gonna go into some more examples of what they say and did and generally how I know they're not just \"thoughts\". \r\n\r\n1. One of them started speaking to me in Spanish, which I can't speak at all. I don't know Spanish at all besides me knowing how to just say my name in Spanish. They weren't telling me that though, it sounded like something much longer and complicated. I recognized only 3 words of what they were saying.\r\n\r\n2. They have agruments with each other pretty often. They also would just come to me and tell about something another voice did to them in the \"inner world\". One time, it was so so overwhelmingly loud because these two were just screaming at each other over something so fucking stupid and small. It was so so so fucking annoying. \r\n\r\n3. They vent to me sometimes about things that's really been bothering them. One voice in particular, I feel like we really bonded because of how much they shared with me. This is how I learned that a lot of them are carrying some serious tramua. \r\n\r\n4. There was a one time where a voice caused a blackout. I just started feeling them there, like right next to me in my head. And then suddenly I'm just overflooded with their laughter. My vision suddenly changed and everything appeared in a pink and blue color. Then things just went completely black. And I found myself in a different position on my bed. I don't remember them saying anything but I know they were there for sure. I even know their name. \r\n\r\nThere's probably more but I don't remember them. \r\n\r\nI've had a lot of out of body experiences and dissociative epsiodes. Two where I saw someone doing and saying something differently to how I speak usually. One where I saw someone try to harm themselves. I didn't really see it though I just heard someone saying that they were going to do that? I can't exactly see during these out of body experiences. I know they were stopped though by another voice I've heard. This was also kinda of a blackout too cuz i don't remember anything that really actually happened. Previously though, a voice was telling me that they were going to come out and hurt themselves so I just assume that's what happened. \r\n\r\nI would say more about that but I feel like this is getting too long already and I think it might be enough? I could always answer more in the comments though to clarify anything if this post was all just too jumbled up. \r\n\r\nOne more clarification! I never took any drugs or alcohol! I'm not diagnosed with anything or on medication for anything. My last clinician did told me that I had depression tho but I was never on any anti-depressants or anything. Idk if that was even a diagnosis I don't think clinicians can diagnose.",

        "answer": "I kind of had a similar experience in the workforce, I earned a graduate degree and failed to enter my field and bounced around about 4 or 5 jobs over the next 8 years. I currently have my own small business doing landscaping projects for people. I am very lucky that my wife has a pretty successful sales career, but my increased availability to support her, spend more quality time, and take care of our dogs and the house while still contributing a little cash has been more fulfilling than any previous.working role I've held. I hated traditional work environments and referred to them as soul crushing also, but my issues were probably not as severe as you describe with your wife. \r\n\r\nI would highly recommend therapy, either single sessions or couples counseling. Not sure what her reasons are for refusing it, but it can be very helpful and therapeutic to air your stress and trauma and formulate constructive steps and strategies you each can take so your wife can live her life with more conviction and less worry. And whatever changes or steps forward she can take always remind her that you're proud of her form making those steps. You sound very supportive of her by trying to take a lot of the burden off of her and I hope you guys can find some balance and she can hopefully feel less uncomfortable in the future. Hope any of that helps.",

        "question": "Hello, Could we appreciate my will not to self harm? Hey,\r\nso a lot of times recently I\u2019ve been thinking about when I started to self harm.\r\nI remember having so strong compulsive thoughts that were so so hard to deal with when I was idk 11, 12. \r\nThe thoughts were so strong that I wanted to do it but then told myself that I can\u2019t and that it\u2019s crazy. So I used to hide the sharp objects, I didn\u2019t want to even see anything, not to shave and so on bc I was really scared that I would do it, deep inside I wanted to but also was scared and I knew that it\u2019s not right.\r\n\r\nAnd I think that I was quite succesful bc I guess I didn\u2019t do it which I find really strange rn so my mind keeps coming back to the past and replaying some memories bc I can\u2019t believe it. I just have some feeling that I had to do it when I had those awful thoughts. But I would probably remember it. Also I didn\u2019t have any cuts on body in pics. I find myself blaming these days for not doing it bc I feel like I deserved it. To do it when I wanted to.\r\nThen I realized that I need to learn that it was kinda brave of me to overcome the thoights without actually doing it (eventho I still find myself coming back and thinking that I should have done it when others did at such a young age)\r\nI  remember doing something with a pin when I was 12 bc I saw boys in class do it.\r\nThen I started cutting when I was 13/14, more likely 14. \r\nMy mind says to me that 14 is too old and that I had to start younger. It\u2019s a horrible feeling.\r\n\r\nSo I think that if I heard other people appreciating me for not doing it before, my thoughts of blaming me and feelings of deserving it would go aside.\r\nStay safe",
        "answer": "Proud of you. Keep it up. Don't compare things like as if there's a younger age to do that or is right better age to do that. It's bad. Take care of yourself, love yourself.  Stop self harm.",

        "question": "Hello Today is one of those bad days. I am in a fight right now against myself. Hello, I am an 22 year old lady from M\u00e9xico. I just have what my brain says is too much food . I don\u2019t know if this subreddit is for this kind of post. But it is important that I talk to somebody or that I express myself. It has been a while since I don't couple with anxiety by \"punishing\" myself, and I didn't do it today. I am so proud but anxious at the same time, because tomorrow is new year eve and I don't know if I would be as strong as today. \r\nIs only that I am trying so hard, and my best seems not to be enough. I am talking about today's family reunion. The problem was that sometimes my family members say hurtful things that desmerit my efforts. They don't do it with the intention of hurting me, but they did it. \r\nMy younger me would only eat her problems out. But I discovered that when I talk to a friend or someone else, the bad thoughts stop. I am talking to you, the person that is reading. But I am also talking to myself. Thanks for reading me. It's that sometimes, I need to remember that I grew, that I am not a child anymore, and that I can handle problems. And when I talk or write something, it helps. Yes, I can, and  I am good enough. So you are<3\r\n\r\nEdit: Thanks for all your support. Now is 2023, and I am doing well. I want to tell you guys that you can also reach me if you need to talk to somebody. Happy new year, I wish you the best :D.",
