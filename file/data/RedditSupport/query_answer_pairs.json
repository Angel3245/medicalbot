Ergo, I wouldn't exist in the future. Then we wouldn't be friends.\r\n\r\nAnd he doesn't understand that his saying I don't deserve to exist because of all of the issues that everyone else may have with Autistic people, being a burden, etc. etc. etc. is hurtful. \r\n\r\nHe cited things like: not making eye contact is rude, the burdens the parents have to endure, the idea that one can\u2019t have a \u201cgood quality of life\u201d if they can\u2019t wipe their own asses (in contrast I\u2019m somehow better off because I can drive a car), non-verbal people can\u2019t drive because they\u2019re non-verbal, and that the unrelated Autism issues like abuse and/or neglect have nothing to with how those experiences impact my Autism/mental health\u2026\r\n\r\nI could go on.

        "question": "Rant/need advice/i think my mom is treating my meds as privileges and using them against me as revenge :( Ok first off i know the title is kinda loaded but let me give you a bit of context. I go by moss(16m/ftm) im trans, dyslexic and autistic (no official diagnosis yet, but working on it), but the only thing my mom might agree with in that statment is that im 16, nothing else. I've suffered a loooot with mental issues in the past altough it's much better now, but during that time i came out as trans which only made thigs worse as my parents are extremely transphobic , and only to make things worse i also developed tics which of course my mom doesn't believe :/. Now as you can imagine that would be a lot for a 13yr boy ||so i ended up in the hospital twice because swerslide attempts|| that's a little of background.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nNow. After a lot of seesions i started taking medicine to go to sleep which i very much depend on, whether it be for my mental health or school, and i also have a medication that sorta works as an SOS (because of my panic/anxeity attacks and meltdowns). Because of the reason i metion before i cannot be the one to manage my medication so my mom does it for me, she's suposed to hand me my sleep medication at 6pm everyday, she even told me to  remind her of it, and im suposed to also have 1 SOS with me at all times but nothing like that is happening. I've started noticing a pattern with my mom's behaviour and i have some solid theories for why they're happening:\r\n\r\n1st- I've noticed that my mom has been treating my meds as privileges or something that i can just live without. I need my sleeping meds at 6pm or else they'll take effect too late and i'll go to sleep at 12am and barely manage to wake up at 6am which causes a lot of stress cuz it just feels awful, if i took them at the right time i'd fall asleep around 8/9pm which would be awesome but yeah. And as you can expect this is really stressful so sometimes when my mom is late with the medication i go and tell her so she'll give me them, but it never works out, when i do that she starts saying stuff like \"watch your tone\" \"you need to be more nice to me\" \"im tired too\" and then she says that she'll give them to me soon BUT SHE GIVES ME THE MED AFTER A WHOLE HOUR AT LIKE 10PM??? anf then i get angry ofc and she starts scolding me, like tf? and this has turned into a huugeee habit now.\r\n\r\n2nd- with my SOS i usually dont have it with me cuz my mom never gives me one when i asked for it like i might be shaking in front of her crying my eyes out, begging for her to give me the SOS and she'll insted ask me what's wrong when i'm basically using all my strength to ask her for the SOS so i kinda give her a bad anwser becuase im so fucking vunerable and unstable. But then when i can actually thell her what's wrong like for example today this happens: me-\"well yk since there's the possiblity of me having asd there's this thing called over-\" mom-\"you dont have that. there's no doubt in my mind\" me\"let me continue- overstimulation that can be caused by social difficulties and stu-\" mom\"you never showed any signs.\" and it just goes one like that and then today was almost my breaking point cuz i was shaking so hard trying to not let the anxeity attack happen (it's happening but it hasn't exploded yet) i just give her the middle finger so she could take the sign because i was laready telling her to stop talking and that she wasn't helping but she kept going so i told her to get out, but she didn't so i just closed my eyes and covered my ears, then after 50 mins she finally gave me the SOS\r\n\r\nI'd like to clarify that in the specific situation up top i had taken my sleeping med and my mom was scared that the meds wouldn't act well toghter, but the reason i don't beleive that is because this is not the first time she has done this not with that reasoning, but she still deprived me of my meds for a long period of time where i was a danger to myself (considering that my last anxeity attack that i had (no med) almost ended super bad).\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nNow theories: \r\n\r\nEver since i came out of the closet my mom has basically resented me and treated me like i took somthing away from her, ever since then she tells me that im rude, bad, untrustworthy, liar, attention seeker and everything along those lines. she also loves to say that it's my fault that our relationship is falling apart and only my fault, she's forgetting that fact that her awnser to me coming out was so bad that i completly shut down and ended in the hospital and ever since then i can barely hug her. she also loves to say that she does EVERYTHINGG for me but i dont give her nothing in return :| but like she told me that giving gifst on holidays and hugging her more would be good so i gave her a gift on christmas and hugged her like a few times but then she kept saying the same stuff. So from that because of that i believe that this is her way of getting back to me. \r\n\r\nBut was really solified this for me was that when i was almost breaking cuz of my anxeity attack and was covering my ears cuz she was breaking my boundaries and saying stuff that hurt me when i told her to stop, she said \"if you dont stop that(covering your ears) im not giving you the SOS\" like, girl, tf? she was holding the SOS as some sort of \"reward\" for acting well.\r\n\r\n(she also took food 'privileges' away from me for a whole day cuz i couldn't eat the soup she made cuz of textures)\r\n\r\nIn conclusion i believe this looks pretty bad but i hope im just overreacting, i hope someone can tell me if im doing so and lend some advice? thanks in advace! :')\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nalso sorry for long text, and errors... this is a complicated situation.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n (im gonna say this now if you pull any kind of funny transphobic stuff in the comments you're getting blocked)",

Find the miserable bits, and shrink them. Regularly have a good think about what is making you happy, and what isn\u2019t, and try to just push a little bit towards the better life. Butting your head against the one-size-fits-all pre-packaged lifestyle and hoping for the best does not work.\r\n\r\nGod, the number of people I see who take a promotion for the extra money and better title and then spend a decade or two miserable\u2026\r\n\r\nFind your life! Not someone else\u2019s.\r\n\r\nA plant in stony soil doesn\u2019t shake its tiny leafy fists at the stones. It just grows its roots around them, looking for the good earth.

You are what you are, and it wouldn\u2019t help you one jot if everyone else\u2019s life was harder to match yours.\r\n\r\nIf you think about what \\*should\\* be, you\u2019ll make yourself miserable. Just try to look at what \\*is\\*, and make the best of it.\r\n\r\nThat\u2019s what I think. I\u2019ve been through it, and that\u2019s my lesson for what it\u2019s worth.\r\n\r\nI eventually found work I can do - immediate stuff, no planning or changing tasks involved: call centre work, and driving a bus.\r\n\r\nI can\u2019t think abut taking promotions or writing a book or making a board game or building the super-sweet app. Maybe it sucks that I can\u2019t do those things, but I can\u2019t. Trying to do those things makes me miserable. Choosing to let it go, to accept my limitations, has been amazing for my mental health.\r\n\r\nShould I feel embarrassed about hiding in my (pretty filthy) room because I\u2019m too overwhelmed to come out? Maybe? But what\u2019s the point? How about I just live my life as best I can.\r\n\r\nMy housemate for the past 5 years now is autistic. We\u2019re in very different places on the ol\u2019 spectrum. To my horror, turns out I\u2019m the clean one. He can only stick to the most rigid routine, while I can only get anything done if it\u2019s spur-of-the-moment. So he gets me: someone who puts out the bins, and intermittently does the bare minimum of cleaning to stop rats moving in. I get him: someone who is totally fine with me hiding in my room for days at a time, and who can be relied on to buy bread every single Thursday whether we need it or not. And we both get someone who will forgive massive hour-long infodumps about weird obsessions-of-the-month.\r\n\r\nI\u2019m late on my taxes. By 5 years. But there was one day late last year I was able to work the courage up to speak to them, and they\u2019re giving me an extension and waving the thousands of dollars in fines, and\u2026 hopefully I\u2019ll get to it any day now. Does that suck? Should I be ashamed? Maybe? But I\u2019m doing what I can and that\u2019s all I can do.\r\n\r\nI\u2019ve been homeless. I\u2019ve been unemployed for over a year, three times. I\u2019ve lost, god, at least half a dozen great jobs trying to find my niche. I\u2019ve spent literally years of my life thinking about ending it, every single day.\r\n\r\nBut I was married 12 years (10 of them really good). I have amazing kids. I finally found jobs I can do without going crazy. I have a good and happy life. I can wish it was better or easier or just \u201cnormal\u201d, whatever that is, but what\u2019s the point? **All I can do is what I can do.**\r\n\r\nI think if I\u2019d realised that sooner, embraced it, a lot of those really dark days would have been a lot brighter.\r\n\r\nSorry this is so long, but I hope it helps a bit.",

And idk if this story belongs in this subreddit but I figured I should post it somewhere. I'm also new to reddit so I don't know how things work yet. \r\n\r\n So, I had a mental breakdown at work... I'm autistic and things can set me off like snarky comments, yelling at me, stress, perfectionism, etc... For some more background, this was the third job I ever had and I'm a 20 year old male. The job was a dishwasher at a local restaurant and the kitchen manager was usually really nice. I always listened to her orders and was a relatively quick learner.\r\n\r\n  Onto the story. So I was doing dishes like usual and I was getting faster and I managed to get everything done before dinner rush. At first, everyone praised me. I started to take a dish that belonged to the front of the restaurant and my boss was the one to make a snarky comment saying \"that's the only dish you're bringing out to the front?\" In my defense, it was the only dish that was clean and able to go out to the front, and that's what set me in a downward spiral... Then people were on their phones and not working on the cooking line when I was trying to get by but they ignored me when I said \"behind\" so I had to say it loudly to get their attention... Then I'm being pulled in different ways to do things and I couldn't do two things at once. One of them was my boss saying \"You should get in the habit of peeling potatoes and portioning fries as soon as you get here.\" But the thing is, every time I arrive to work, the dishes and everything in that station is chaos so I have to catch up on dishes before I do anything else. Then when my boss told me that I need to reorganize pots, I did it aggressively because I snapped mentally... When I was done I started to cry... It was the end of the day and she pulled me aside and yelled at me. She then said that my behavior was unacceptable on how I was \"throwing pots around\" and apparently cornering someone while she was trying to talk to me, even though I never saw her in the kitchen. There were people in the way, but I told them that I was coming through and they moved. Then she aggressively told me that I shouldn't bother clocking out because she'll do it for me and to just go home... I texted her the next morning with a little help on what to say and she told me to call her. She then said that since it's January, things should be pretty slow and I'm no longer needed... All I did was aggressively take heavy pots down from the shelf, aggressively set them down and reorganized them, then set them back up. Then just scrub really hard on the dishes and kept muttering that everything must be perfect. Nothing was destroyed and no one was hurt during and after my fit. So AITA here?",

        "question": "I'm not sure how to deal with my autistic neighbor's behaviors So, just for reference, I'm also autistic, although most people don't know because I'm \"high functioning.\" I live in a \"townhouse\" type of apartment. Here's some relevant background info:\r\n\r\nMy upstairs neighbor is also autistic. He lives on his own, but his parents come to help him a few times a week as he can't drive. He is a freelancer, so he also has a website in which he identifies himself as an autistic artist, so this is how I know that he is autistic. He is extremely extremely social - to the point where I wonder if he was misdiagnosed as autistic and actually has Williams Syndrome. The entire town knows him because he is so social. He will walk down the street and stop at every shop to talk to whoever is inside. He has no fear or anxiety around these social interactions.\r\n\r\nHere's the scenario I'm dealing with atm:\r\n\r\nEver since I moved into my new apartment, my neighbor has constantly tried talk to me whenever he can. This was fine until it got to the point where I every time I open the door to leave my apartment or arrive back at my apartment after an outing, my neighbor runs out to \"greet me\" and try to talk to me. I mean every single time. The walls in my apartment are very thin, so he is hearing my front door opening and running down to greet me as fast as he can before I leave (and I can hear his running, too). Also, he must be watching out of his window to see when my car pulls into the parking lot because, whenever I come home from somewhere, he immediately opens his door (which across the street from mine) to stop and bombard me with his questions.\r\n\r\nIt all feels very weird to me and frankly, I don't want to talk to this person anymore. It almost seems like stalking or harassment, although I know he doesn't mean it that way. When I leave my apartment, I'm usually trying to get somewhere like work, and I am often running late. I don't have time for him.When I come home, I'm often just wanting to decompress in my apartment, and I just don't want to make small talk...I hate small talk... I never know what to do or how to answer. I'm extremely introverted. I try to answer whatever question he asks and get into my apartment or my car as quickly as I can.\r\n\r\nThe result of all of this is that I have anxiety about leaving or returning to my apartment because I know that I will have to deal with my neighbor. A couple of months ago, I told my neighbor that when he does this, it makes me very uncomfortable and makes me not want to leave my apartment. I told him to please stop \"greeting me\" whenever I leave or come home. He stopped doing it for about a month, but then restarted a few weeks ago.\r\n\r\nIt would be different if I occasionally ran into my neighbor by chance. But these encounters aren't happening by chance. He's even make excuses to get me to open my door lately, like picking up amazon packages outside of my door, knocking on my door (to get me to open the door) to inform me that they're there, and then trying to take the conversation somewhere else. I don't need him to do that for me, and I don't want him to do that.\r\n\r\nI just don't know what to do anymore. I don't want to make him feel bad because he's clearly trying to be friends with me...but I'm not interested in being friends with him. How can I make this stop?",

        "question": "Need some advice. ND Mom to an ADHD/Autistic 13 year old son. He has been complaining about not liking his medicine for a while. He takes 20 mg Adderall once a day, when he takes his meds he is able to complete tasks and has a much better day. Recently he started outright refusing to take them. This week I made him take it but I felt guilty like I was taking his choice away. If he doesnt take his meds he has a difficult time completing simple tasks such as his chores not to mention getting any schooling(homeschool) done is a nightmare. He says that he doesnt like how they make him feel that it slows him down. How can I help him understand that the medicine does help and he needs it? Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated. We already tried different meds when he was younger so med change may not work.",
        "answer": "I did this with Ritalin. All reports said I was doing \"so much better\" but I basically fwlt like I was hyperfocused all the time but with no subject.

Be a person.\r\n\r\nI was doing all the things people wanted me to do and being an oh-so-good child... But I was dying inside.\r\n\r\nI'd say listen to your kid. If he doesn't like how he feels on it, that is more important than being able to play neurotypical. He might need meds, but not *thise* meds or he may be able to use apps and timers and reminders and make lifestyle changes that don't involve medication.\r\n\r\nThey are not neurotypical. Doing all the things a \"normal\" person does is useless if they are not happy.",

When you first meet him you wouldn't know he was neurodivergent, he just reads as like a cool guy that doesn't talk too much and you cant read him at all. but after his mom told me he was on the spectrum some things just clicked. his excessive spending on hobbies, his monotone voice, and his overall lack of expression suddenly had an actual explanation. i mean i dont really care what he spends his money on, but the monotone voice and just how he has chronic bored face has been eating me up inside. he just seems like hes never enthusiastic and i have bad anxiety so i automatically think hes mad at me or he think im annoying and stuff. its crazy cuz over text he is so expressive! is there any ways we can like cope with this? i cant think if a good word. like any way we can work around this so i dont have to be worried all the time and he doesnt feel bad for something he cant control. so far i've jus been going to the bathroom and texting him asking if hes mad at me. thank you for taking time to read!",
        "answer": "First off, hats off to you for being self aware enough to know that your emotions, especially in this particular scenario, are your responsibility. That is huge. A lot of people much older than you never learn this simple truth. \r\n\r\nYou know the things that are triggering you are not your boyfriend's fault, because you know he isn't doing those things on purpose. But you feel what you feel nonetheless. This advice may be too far out there for you, but try first and foremost to take several deep breaths and then accept what you feel. While the explanations we give for why we feel the way we do are not always valid, the feelings themselves are. So take the mental position of welcoming what you feel. Then move onto noticing and then questioning the truthfulness of the thoughts swirling in your mind whenever you feel triggered. For instance, you start thinking he's mad at you. Simply ask yourself if that's really true and if so, how do you know. Interrogate yourself. Gently, and with kindness, because you are doing the best you can. Play around with alternative explanations, like maybe he's not mad or maybe you can't read his mind or maybe he's content, etc.\r\n\r\nLike I said, this advice may be too esoteric for you. But that is what I'd do if I were in your shoes.",

        "question": "Struggling to stop using cocaine, could use some support I had done coke a few times before at parties etc when offered, but last summer I started buying my own. At first it was purely recreational, I liked feeling more confident and going out to dance with a bag in my pocket. Mostly weekends, sometimes I'd get a bag and go out on a weeknight, and it'd last me a couple of days. \r\n\r\nWell fast forward a couple of months, and it started catching up with me. Tired all the time, depressed, no motivation, work performance slipping. That was the tipping point where I should have stopped. Instead, I started bringing it to work, where I'd dip out of the office every hour or so for bumps in the bathroom. I was basically self medicating my ADHD with coke instead of Adderall. \r\n\r\nOf course, I didn't stop using when the work day ended. I'd get home, go to the bar and make conversation with strangers in between trips to the bathroom.\r\n\r\nThat was back in September. I've been going through a gram a day for about 4 months now, and I'm paying the price. I really want to stop, but during the week I'm afraid I won't be able to function at work, and when the weekend rolls around I just wind up partying again.\r\n\r\nIm thinking of taking a personal day this Friday, deleting my dealers number and taking the long weekend to jump start my recovery. I'm going to delete my dealer's number, try my best to go to the gym or at least do some walking outside, pick some comfort movies to watch - if you want to drop any more tips I'd be grateful.\r\n\r\nMuch love to you all!",
        "answer": "Hi there. What a deja vu. I\u2019ve seen this movie and I know how it ends\u2026 \r\n\r\nIn my case it was 2016. I was at the same spot\u2026 In a span of two weeks, work got so stressful, I did so much coke one night that I could not get out of my room next morning. Had to call in sick. And again. And again. I lost control. I lost the job. \r\n\r\nCocaine addiction can escalate pretty fast. I spent about two years (2015/2016) in heavy addiction. I mean heavy. Four day benders. Almost oded a few times. Nothing made me stop, until I lost my job and it hit me in the face.\r\n\r\nI tried to quit on my own for a while, I spent three months in bed eating and sleeping and fighting the urge to go out and buy more. Then I had a nasty relapse. I only got the grip on recovery when I started seeing a therapist. She helped me get my life back on track.\r\n\r\nSo my tip, from someone that has been in the ups and downs of coke recovery since 2016, is get professional help. Go to a group or get a therapist, or a doctor. It\u2019s so much easier and effective when you have someone guiding you. \r\n\r\nBe patient and be strong. It took me several months to stop shaking and feeling dizzy out of the blue. I felt numb and stuck for a long time, until I started going on long morning walks, that really changed everything. Go to bed early, try to go for walks in the sun, lots of sun, eat heathy (but keep ice cream in hand, ice cream is wonderful to cut the cravings) and keep busy during the day. Keep so busy that when party time comes you are so tired, all you want is a good night sleep. You will thank yourself in the morning.\r\n\r\nAlso I had to change all of my friends. I only felt really free from coke in 2021. I almost slipped back during 2020\u2026 Had to let go of all my party people. Up until this day, I don\u2019t trust myself around coke, so I avoid people and places where I know there will be blow.  \r\n\r\nThe hardest thing you already did, that is admitting you have a problem. You can do this. Trust me, it\u2019s worth it. Life is so much better without cocaine. \r\n\r\nGood luck!!",

        "answer": "That is something you have to admit truthfully to yourself. As someone who works with addicts, and is personally affected by life with an addict-there is no point in others telling you you have a problem. You have to find that truth in yourself and admit that you are powerless over cocaine. Being powerless doesn't mean you can't quit, it means you know that one is too many, and a thousand is never enough. If you can't put it down, and one line is never enough, you know you don't have power over cocaine, cocaine has power over you. If you feel this is true, then there is hope and there is an answer-sobriety. \r\n\r\nLife without that cocaine can be beautiful, and the cocaine use does not dictate a good time. You do. Your body, mind, finances, social life and future will all be destroyed if you keep on this path. You deserve a good life, you deserve to be happy, and you deserve freedom. I have had unsuccessful resuscitation of patients who went into cardiac arrest from use alone, or from patients who had their cocaine cut with fentanyl or other harmful tranquilizers. Every addict thinks-its not going to happen to them. That they're the exception. Please take care of yourself, there's a good world out there. It deserves you in it.",

        "answer": "Hi, there. Fellow coke addict here.\r\n\r\nWhen I first tried to quit coke, after a few years of heavy abuse, I managed to get three months clean, and when I was feeling better I started yoga. I felt so good and so happy about it! Guess what? I relapsed hard. Got a few more months clean, was feeling so happy, relapsed.\r\n\r\nWhen I finally decided to get help, one of the first things I learned in therapy is that an addict\u2019s comfort zone is down the hole. Our minds tricks us into not accepting happiness, like if we don\u2019t deserve it. It\u2019s a mix of guilty and fear and self-sabotage. So you have tools in therapy to reset this behavior and go back to \u201cnormal\u201d.\r\n\r\nTo me it was a long process of learning to love myself, to love and cherish my life, my family, my friends, my work, my clients\u2026 I used coke as an escape from some really bad depression and self-destructive behaviors I had long before cocaine entered my life\u2026 I sabotaged myself in other ways, with over drinking, always feeling defensive and criticized, always angry and jealous, having meaningless one-night stands with strangers\u2026 When I tried coke it made me feel awesome and sexy and dangerous and edgy\u2026 Wow, it was the recipe for disaster and I was instantly hooked.\r\n\r\nFast-forward to rock bottom loosing a job and almost dying, I go to therapy and learn all this awful things about myself I wasn\u2019t aware before.   \r\n\r\nMy point is: if you really want to quit, get some professional help. A good therapist can help you discover your triggers, your motives and how to break this pattern.\r\n\r\nMy tools have been routine, creating good new habits, getting close to nature and sunlight, and gratitude. Be grateful. Take a look around, pay attention to all this good moments and people you say you missed, and tell yourself you deserve it. You deserve this happiness, you deserve your job, you deserve this guy you like, you deserve your your family and friends. Convince yourself how important you are to them, and how they want you to be there, and you will be your best self to be there for them and to cherish this moments.\r\n\r\nRecovery can be painful, therapy can be painful, but it really pays off. Of course life is not perfect and there will be bad days when you feel defeated and tempted to go down the hole again, but there\u2019s a point you can reach when you identify the exact moment you want to self-sabotage and you go for a walk or have an ice-cream instead of stuffing your face in blow.\r\n\r\nUse this moment of venting to take control of your life, you have the right motivation! \r\n\r\nTake care and good luck!",

        "question": "Almost 30 and had over 60 different jobs longest one held was 10 months. I\u2019m 29 turning 30 in March. I got my first job when I was 20. It lasted about a month then I went to another one. Since then I\u2019ve gone from job to job for the past 10 years and the longest running job I\u2019ve had was 10 months. I can\u2019t believe how much time has gone by and I\u2019m still stuck in the same cycle I was in all those years ago. I\u2019m starting to worry about the future and if I\u2019ll ever find a steady job. Now just to let everyone know I was diagnosed with Asperger\u2019s syndrome when I was a child, it\u2019s a minor form of autism so that alone can make it hard to secure steady employment because of things like struggling to communicate effectively, motor skill deficiency, etc. If anyone has any helpful advice it would be greatly appreciated thanks.",

This is a small, close group and I\u2019m very comfortable with everyone there. We start at 1 and can go to 3-5.\r\n\r\nThe problem is the entire day before the session, sometimes bleeding into the day before too, I feel extremely anxious and overwhelmed. I get super irritated and snappy. This is super odd because I want to play DND and I shouldn\u2019t be this anxious. I can\u2019t really describe what I feel then, only that it\u2019s very intense and extreme. \r\n\r\nI also crash immediately after the session is done and can\u2019t really do anything for the rest of the day, even if I enjoyed my time playing. \r\n\r\nI\u2019m wondering if anyone has experienced something like this and if there\u2019s any explanation that can help me figure out what\u2019s happening.\r\n\r\nEdit: after talking with my wife, I realized that the feeling is like going to my law school classes, if that helps.

I don\u2019t have close friends to hang out with, I don\u2019t have people I don\u2019t to on a daily basis, I feel like I\u2019m someone who is not really missed or cared for by peers. Sometimes it seems like no one cares to associate themselves with me. \r\n\r\nI feel isolated. I feel as if I don\u2019t have anywhere to turn. Feel like I have no one to talk to. \r\n\r\nI\u2019m predominantly lonely in my romantic life. I don\u2019t have hope I will have anyone, it seems too good to be true. I put myself in this predicament. My one relationship that I can\u2019t break is pornography. At this point, now I\u2019m just going to pornography to fulfill the bodily pleasures I have, but to fulfill the loneliness I have. The sad thing is, I know it\u2019s the very relationship with pornography that has caused me to be lonely, caused me to seek out strangers on anonymous chat forums, caused me to go out less and become antisocial; caused me to become depressed, less motivated, anxious, stressed, dependent on pleasure, empty, calloused, broken, ashamed. \r\n\r\nI feel I can\u2019t produce healthy relationships, friendly or romantic. My focus of romantic relationships become solely based on physical intimacy, not necessarily sexual, but touching and feeling through hugs, holding of hands. I know relationships are much more than that and certainly much deeper on an emotional and spiritual level than physical. \r\n\r\nPornography has warped my view on others, myself, relationships, reality. It has helped me to isolate myself, develop trust issues, become broken and breaking others, distort my thinking, pervert my thoughts; prevented me to succeed and live a healthy, proactive life. \r\n\r\nI hate myself. I hate my lifestyle. After doing something for so long, you\u2019re so used to it, that though you despise it, you can\u2019t seem to break it out of comfort. \r\n\r\nPeople can recognize drug addicts, alcoholics; any sort of addictive behavior.

He just hates all my autistic parts and I have to have my alone time when I have my autism stuff because it annoys him. He says he loves me, he just says I have a lot to work on. When I talk to my workers about things they just explain how hard it is for someone like me and he should be more understanding but then when I tell him that he says I only feel that way because that\u2019s what the doctors and workers tell me and it ruins my brain. He gets mad at my extreme emotions and gets mad when I snap when he\u2019s picking at me. He hates when I do the teeth clenching stim. He says he loves me, but I\u2019m also supporting him financially this past year he hasn\u2019t had a job. He tells me I had all this support as a kid but my symptoms were ignored until highschool so I didn\u2019t have any till then but he makes me feel guilty for feeling bad ab out some bad things that happened in my childhood cuz he has it worse. My parents do support me but I was left out as a kid because both my brothers were diagnosed. And I wasn\u2019t. I just feel guilty for having this disorder because it\u2019s such a burden to the person  I love.",

        "question": "Homemade Weighted Blanket I'm not autistic myself, but I thought people here might benefit from this tip. Weighted blankets are expensive and can be hard to come across, so years ago my mom made me one out of an extra duvet cover we had. She sewed long columns, filled each with some weighted filling, sewed a row closed, and repeat until it's a bunch of squares with equal filling. If that makes any sense. \r\n\r\nI'm sure theres videos and tutorials on that part, but the thing I thought was really brilliant was the weighted filling. We didnt want to buy the stuff they use in real weighted blankets because it was expensive and shipping was super expensive, so we brainstormed for a few days and guys. FISH ROCKS!! Or aquarium gravel, I think it's actually called. It's way cheaper and, unlike other rocks or heavy small things, it needs to be smooth and without any sharp edges for the safety of the fish. \r\n\r\nDisclaimer: This wont work for everyone, especially if you have sensitivity to noise. This blanket doubled as a maraca. On the other hand, if you're sensitive to overheating then it's a million times better than the store bought weighted blanket I have now. It was never too hot and it was such a blessing on hot nights because I didnt have to have multiple hot blankets just to get some nice weight.\r\n\r\nTL;DR: Aquarium gravel is smooth, heavy, and cheap filling for a homemade weighted blanket if you don't mind that it's a bit louder than a regular one.",

I like how it makes me feel dizzy and relaxed. \r\nthe largest amount I took was 3 pills (3mg each). recently I've been using it almost every day (usually just 1) or every night so I can sleep without waking up multiple times. \r\nI'm careful not to mix it with alcohol or energy drinks (I did that one time and it was really bad) but I do smoke cigarettes daily.\r\n\r\nsymptoms I noticed when I skip taking it:\r\nfast and strong heartbeat (sometimes it feels like my heart stops for a moment and my breathing too, and then it goes back to normal or just beats really hard), feeling nervous, anxious, light-headedness (sometimes), fast breathing and panicking because I'm not sure if I'm about to have a heart attack or faint or it's just anxiety.

I have several other accommodations (they don\u2019t really help, but whatever) and at my last meeting I requested to be able to wear my noise cancelling headphones. They said I could do it during independent work just not while the teacher is giving instructions. This I was fine with, but then they said I couldn\u2019t wear them during a test. For me, tests are still \u201cnoisy\u201d because even though talking isn\u2019t allowed, that just means that all the background noise is amplified. I can hear people clicking on their computers, tapping their feet, tapping their pencil, shifting around, etc. I told them this and they said that due to cheating, they couldn\u2019t make an exception. I told them that my headphones, while electronic, are not hooked up to my phone and I don\u2019t even use them to play music. I just use them to block out sound. They didn\u2019t care. They said that they could instead take me to a \u201cquiet room\u201d for testing, but I have numerous reasons why this wouldn\u2019t work for me. They still didn\u2019t care.

Giving yourself the permission and taking on the personal responsibility of doing so. Aware of the risks as such, that you may branch out a little bit, here and there - and then maybe - have a few blowouts. That's entirely a reasonable possibility. Who knows really what the consequences of that might be.\r\n\r\nMore than that though, how would/might this impact your relationships? With your wife and children? What's the worst possible outcome that you might face here? What's the best possible outcome you could achieve? And looking at both of them; is the person you want to be?\r\n\r\nIt would be unusual for you not, from time to time, to have intrusive thoughts. If you're tired, from not enough sleep. Or maybe you're not interacting enough in meaningful relationships with people; your environment really plays a massive role here. Well, it can start to play a trick or two on you. You start to have doubts; \"Oh, just once - what harm can it really do?\" \r\n\r\nSometimes you just have to acknowledge that you're not feeling great about life or some aspects of it. And then just say; \"Okay, so I'm feeling / thinking these things. They're just thoughts. I don't need them, so I can let them go.\" And you really can. That's the power you have now; you can make a choice. Sometimes we don't realise how much influence in the outcomes of our lives, and that there is a space for us to make a choice. We can influence our impulses.\r\n\r\nI wish you well. I really do. You made a choice to come and get support. That's shows you have a level of depth and maturity. That you care. Things may still provoke or irritate you, but don't forget that you have come so far already. And you still have a way to go. Just how that turns out, lies at your feet.",

        "question": "Went over a year without taking cocaine really annoyed with myself So things were going really well. I was only drinking once a month really and a few drinks only. Maximum 5 pints. It came to this weekend and I was meeting up with a mate who I know does it but I felt sure of myself I\u2019d not bother taking it as I didn\u2019t last time I was at his. Anyway as the night went on I ended up doing about 5 lines and drunk way more than I thought I was going to. This happened Friday and I still feel anxious as I have a presentation to do tomorrow. How do you guys try go easy on yourself. I\u2019m currently catching up with work and I keep telling myself that I am an absolute idiot for taking it too far and should have controlled myself better. I know being this critical never helps anyone. I thought I\u2019d just let the frustrations out hopefully be the last for a while",

        "question": "Bare with me please I\u2019m an addict taking that hardest first step. I became an meth addict. I quit Friday morning. I\u2019ve always been a functioning addict but when I lost my live in gf of 5 years, a few weeks later my company sold and my management position was eliminated and I was partnerless and jobless in a big house that requires two earners to afford. My abuse went into over drive. I was using it to cope with what clearly was depression setting in. I played the tough guy and pretended I was doing fine and things were getting better. I moved closer to family and yet continued my self destruction. I\u2019m sure they\u2019ve noticed but I thought I hid it. After a few months I found a good job so I thought. I watched for other opportunities as upper management worked me to the ground. So I continued using on the same pace as I had begun after the breakup. Finally one day before Christmas I sat with my boss and said I can\u2019t keep working into the ground and watch my life balance completely disappear. I wasn\u2019t able to date to see friends and I saw my family less than when I lived in another state. Our separation was ammlicable.  But I continued to use. Haven\u2019t found a job and have done nothing but stew about what came and went in my life this year and how a habit is clearly to blame in a lot of this. I\u2019ve slept much of it off the last two days and I\u2019m not fuzzy mentally at the moment. But the emotional havoc my mind is having when I think to the past and all that I\u2019ve lost and all that\u2019s been removed from my life that I held so dearly because of my selfishness and my addiction just makes me sick. I know right now I need to focus on what my future can bring by being sober and never touching this dream killer again and later come to terms with the past but damn it\u2019s hard. I don\u2019t wanna touch the stuff or see the stuff ever again and I\u2019ll never forgive myself for what I let do to me. But how can I begin to to see what good will come for saying I\u2019m done no more I will not let this drug suck me in? There is a lyric from a song that I keep sticking to give me strength.  \u201cThe change begins with one step. However small the first step is hardest of all. But when I get my gait I\u2019ll be walking tall\u201d I know I can get my life back. Thank you for reading.",

It\u2019s a difficult decision to stick to, but the good thing is, with meth the wd\u2019s aren\u2019t physical, you might get some stomach cramps and be excessively tired and hungry, I\u2019ve quit many times and the only positive thing I could tell myself some days was \u201cthank god I\u2019m not wd from heroin\u201d.  and also it helps to remember that there\u2019s no way in hell reintroducing meth into your life will improve your lifestyle.",

        "question": "Do you also feel like you're not human? I'm a lvl 2 autistic person (almost lvl 3), with adhd, high abilities, and savantism (and paranoid personality disorder, actually). One thing that I feel very strongly is how I'm totally different from neurotypicals, to the point that I totally feel like I'm not human. Its like I'm hidden among them, copying their behaviour to fit in (because I do like them), but that's not the case at all. Its so uncanny how I can relate to robots and androids on movies, due to their logic and way of learning. Neurotypicals seems very confusing and chaotic to me; most things they do and say don't make sense whatsoever. I do spend a lot of time consuming media to copy human neurotypical behaviour, like movies and books. I do perform way above average (have high IQ, took courses at Harvard, going medical school now) and I'm a very fast reader (hiperlexia) that can easily manage goals and some taks; but its just to totally fail in some activities and a mixed feeling of being around people that seems both less inteligent at most things, but seems to do magic things (like recognize people from their faces, drive, or understand social situations from a non-theoretical point of view).\r\n\r\nDo any of you also fell like that? I also have some very strong insights due to hiperfocus, so these are periods of intense, almost maniac creativity. Do you guys also have it?

He knows about my ASD and everything was cute or quirky or something we would handle together until recently. I work a very intense job as a department head and have to be \u2018on\u2019 all day Monday through Saturday. It\u2019s exhausting for me. I talk to him on the phone as much as I can during the work day while he\u2019s driving and text when I can\u2019t talk. I felt like I was doing really well but lately we have blow ups where he says I\u2019m not communicating enough. Today was bad. He said I don\u2019t love him and don\u2019t want him and don\u2019t care about his needs because I try to take Sundays to decompress and we didn\u2019t talk on the phone for 3 days. \r\n\r\nI tried to work through it but he just kept texting me how bad I was making him feel.

        "question": "How to survive alone Hey, UK here. I was diagnosed with autism and ADHD a year ago (I am 26). I also have severe depression + dysthymia. I still live with my mum (62) and I\u2019m terrified for what will happen when she dies. My dad isn\u2019t in the picture and I have no other immediate family. She does everything for me and I have tried to be more independent but I can barely manage to brush my teeth most days. I know nothing about our finances, about the house, about tax, about anything, and even if I did, I wouldn\u2019t be able to cope with managing them. \r\n\r\nI feel like a fraud for saying this because I am considered \u2018low support needs\u2019 and have no learning disabilities (unless you count ADHD but my grades were fine). I can speak and socialise and I don\u2019t have epilepsy or seizures or anything like that. \r\n\r\nYet I just feel with some certainty that when my mum dies I will end up dead one way or another because I can\u2019t look after myself or do adult things. I doubt I\u2019d be able to get a carer because I\u2019m not \u2018autistic enough\u2019 and I\u2019m freaking out, I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m gonna do. This is not a post about handling grief - this is me genuinely thinking I will die without the support that my mother gives me and being terrified of that. Has anyone gone through something similar?",
        "answer": "Long post so TLDR: Your mum can help you prepare for this now, and there's lots of small steps that will help if you can take any of them. Try to get her to take on the task of accessing that support for you, so it's not all on her, and she can help to get you through it with her support.\r\n\r\nIf you haven't already, I think it might be good to have this conversation with your mum (or have it again) and try to get her to *use her time with you to help you safeguard your future*. If you can't present this as 'I don't know how I'm going to survive when you die', you could come at it as 'I want to access all the state and charity help available to me, so I'm not a burden as you're getting older, and you can enjoy you retirement'. Parents often default to just focusing on taking care of you, but some extra support would help you care for her too.\r\n\r\nIf you're not already on benefits, get her to help you get it sorted. Even if you don't need the income, it gives you national insurance contributions, which you'll need to have a pension. Universal credit isn't much, but there are sometimes upticks for sickness and disability that may apply. You can apply for PIP on top of that, which is a long process and requires some fighting, but can bring you around \u00a3300 a month. You can ask the local council for a social worker and an occupational therapist. They might help anyway, but more importantly, this will give you official allies other than your mum, and create a useful paper record of people who can authenticate that you can't function alone. One day you might need this to qualify for benefits or sheltered living. The local council can put you on a waitlist for supported living, too. It takes years, and you don't necessarily need to take anything they offer you (you can say it's not suitable if it's too far from your mum), but again, it keeps you in the system so when your mom's not around, you don't have to engage for the first time alone. \r\n\r\nCitizens Advice can help with all of this. You mum can make appointments for you and go with you to them to advocate for you. They'll tell you what to write on applications, and how to articulate your difficulties. Local charity branches like Scope and Mind might offer in person support, and Scope has online help too. It may be worth going to your GP, too, and asking if there's any support you haven't already tried. They often know local stuff you won't hear about otherwise. Again, your mum can come and basically do the appointment for you - and it can be on the phone if that's easier, you don't need to say anything except confirming your details and that you'd like her to speak for you. If you think it would be helpful, you can also request to be referred back into autism services for a reassessment that states in writing that you need support for daily living.\r\n\r\nAll these things might seem overwhelming and of little immediate value, but they're the kind of things that are much easier to handle with a parent to advocate than they are alone. Doing any of them will give you allies and evidence when you need it. You can line everything up now to make sure you'll be safer and secure longer term. \r\n\r\nI've been alone and nonfunctional without parental support after I came out, and I really wished I'd used the support available to me while I still had it. I accrued a lot of trauma that could've been avoided if I'd asked my parents to set me up for independence, back while I still had their support. The best gift your mum can give you, as a parent, is access to the support you need to be able to survive her. She must worry about this too, and helping each other think about it and prepare for it will be good for both of you in the long run. Every little bit helps. Best of luck to you.",

        "question": "What's a reasonable boundary to set re. my friend's cocaine use? I'm not an expert, but from what I can tell, my friend is a drug addict. Primarily he uses cocaine but he has experimented with harder substances. He has good times and bad times, where he uses more (like multiple times a week) and reacts worse.\r\n\r\nDuring the bad times he is incredibly difficult to deal with, and he can be very mean. After a very bad recent episode I threatened to end our friendship over his out-of-control drug use for my own mental health, and he told me he would get clean. AFAIK he was clean for a few months, then he took cocaine again. He told me that his therapist has agreed that it's fine to do cocaine occasionally, as long as he doesn't do anything harder.\r\n\r\nMy question is: how often is actually reasonable? I understand that some people can do it occasionally without developing a critical issue, but I don't feel super confident in my friend's ability to self-regulate. As such, I want to set a clear boundary about how much cocaine use I can tolerate from him, something along the lines of \"if you do cocaine more frequently than X amount of times per X unit of time measurement then I'll have to re-evaluate our friendship.\" Is once per month reasonable? I'd feel more comfortable with maybe once every two or three months, but is that too restrictive? Or am I going about this totally wrong? I want to set a boundary, yes, but I also want it to be a limit that he can reasonably adhere to.\r\n\r\nSorry for the essay. Grateful for any advice.",

I don\u2019t have a good answer for you, I\u2019m not sure there is one. Actually, any time his drug abuse affects you is unacceptable and it\u2019s okay to let them know that.

My ibuprofen and antibiotic are fine but not norco is missing 2. \r\nI also struggle with the fact a that his addiction is with him probably forever because he to this day has not gotten professional help or ever been to therapy like he has promised me so many times over at least the last 2 years. \r\nI\u2019m frustrated and I\u2019m hurt. \r\n\r\nI need to ask him but I don\u2019t know what to do or how to do it. I understand to certain extents the way he hides and lies with slip ups, and it\u2019s nearly ended or relationship at least once.  I guess I am asking here because I do not know where to turn and I am hoping someone from his shoes might be able to give me any advice.",
        "answer": "First off, so sorry you\u2019re going through this. IRD incredibly painful to watch the ones we love do things that hurt us and themselves. \r\n\r\nA few thoughts I have\u2026 \r\n\r\n1. An addict has an addiction that stays with them forever regardless of if they get professional help or not. Professional help (therapist, 12 steps, SMART recovery, treatment program, sponsor, support network, etc) is to develop tools and new coping mechanisms with an aim to increase the likelihood of staying sober. The addiction will always be in the background, that\u2019s why guys with 20 years sober still say they got there \u201cone day at a time\u201d. \r\n\r\n2. Don\u2019t ask him, because he might deny it and that will make you crazy. Always trust your gut. Tell him you know and do not need to argue or prove you know. Do not give in or give room to negotiate what you know happened. Walk away if you have to and go silent and wait. \r\n\r\n3. Set boundaries, and make sure you are prepared to follow through. Anger or hurt feelings without boundaries does not inspire changed behavior. Boundaries without follow through erase your credibility. Consider things like \u201cI will not be in a relationship with an addict who is not pursuing recovery and following all treatment recommendations\u201d. Or \u201cgoing forward all narcotic medication will be going on a safe only I have the combination to\u201d.\r\n\r\n4. If he won\u2019t get help, you can for you, therapy, and alanon /naranon, etc are available for you to help you navigate. \r\n\r\nBest of luck OP.",

For background context, I'm lds and I hate it, plan on becoming inactive when I turn 18. We had to do a youth activity and it was everyone combined, and we had to do minute to win it games. My group sucked, I was with kids who were very loud and obnoxious, and once the games started everyone was just screaming and yelling, and it was very ovsrstimulating to me.

I feel a little better now that I'm away from all the noise and such, but I still feel like I'm on the verge of breaking down crying.

        "answer": "Breathe in for 5 seconds, hold your breath for 2 seconds, and breathe out for 7 seconds. Repeat until you feel calmer. It\u2019ll help slow your heart rate down and activate your sympathetic nervous system. This will help calm you down physically.\r\n\r\nFor a \u201csensory reset,\u201d find a room you feel comfortable in, maybe your bedroom. Lower the light level to a comfortable level, or turn them off completely. For sound, either listen to something you like, or nothing at all if it\u2019s already quiet. Wear clothing you feel most comfortable in. This will help bring you back to base level, sensory-wise.\r\n\r\nIf you have a lot of thoughts in your head, talk to someone you trust. Maybe your dad, since it seems like he\u2019d understand. If talking is too much at the moment, try writing them down instead. This will help you process your thoughts and emotions and help get them out of your system.\r\n\r\nA hot drink and a good safe meal/snack will help rebuild your energy.\r\n\r\nThis is stuff that I find helpful.

It\u2019s a thin line.\r\n\r\nHe watches nursery rhymes on TV while we both work from home. Our daughter isn\u2019t in the room with us. It\u2019s just the two of us.\r\n\r\nHe isn\u2019t actually interested in the nursery rhymes but my mum or MIL puts them on for our daughter when she is babysitting. Its those super simple songs nursery rhyme songs. It\u2019s background noise. It\u2019s driving me insane. He\u2019s gotten used to the noise and visuals when my mum or MIL is watching our daughter while he\u2019s working from home.\r\n\r\nI\u2019m working from home at the moment as well. I occasionally sit on the sofa while working which is opposite the tv.\r\n\r\nHe sits at the dinner table essentially facing the tv sideways as well. For him it\u2019s some visual/auditory stim. I want to respect his comfort but at the same time I want him to respect mine if I do decide to sit in the living room. Even with the noise cancelling headphones the visuals are bothering me. He got very defensive when I tried turning it off and asked me why I\u2019m even sitting here.\r\n\r\nWhat can I do to be more understanding?",
        "answer": "My take as an autistic person is that your sensory needs are not inherently less important than your husband's sensory needs, even if you happen to be neurotypical or don't have any diagnosis. \r\n\r\nYou are being sufficiently understanding of your husband's sensory needs. I think that the problem is that only your husband's sensory needs are being accommodated in the household, when your sensory needs are valid as well. Everyone has sensory needs, including neurotypicals. \r\n\r\nIf the noise and visuals make you feel like you are being driven insane, then that's a serious problem, and your husband should care about your wellbeing in addition to his own. Having autism doesn't make you exempt from caring about your spouse or mean that no one else's needs have to be taken into consideration. I don't think that you should have to suffer just because he likes rituals. \r\n\r\nI think he needs to work out some sort of compromise if you feel like you are being driven insane by the noise. This sounds like a case of [conflicting access needs (article from Thinking Person's Guide to Autism)](https://thinkingautismguide.com/2018/10/acknowledging-and-accepting-competing-accessibility.html).\r\n\r\nHave you tried telling him how much the noise stresses you out?\r\n\r\nDo you think he might have OCD in addition to autism?\r\n\r\nWhatever is going on, he absolutely needs to be willing to listen to you and take your discomfort seriously.\r\n\r\nAnother thing: I don't know your gender, so I don't know if this is relevant to your particular situation, but a lot of women are taught that they are supposed to put their husbands' needs before their own and sacrifice their personal wellbeing for their husbands' comfort or convenience. Some people who aren't women also struggle with the subconscious belief that only their partner's needs are important.",

My school doesn't know I'm autistic (I was diagnosed a few months ago and I'm an adult, so I didn't feel the need to tell them).\r\n\r\nI can handle noise by wearing earplugs when it gets overwhelming, so I've got that covered. The teachers probably don't even notice when I'm wearing them. \r\n\r\nMy main issue is LIGHTS. The lights bother me so much. There are a few classrooms where the lights are super bright and they make me feel like my head is about to explode. There are days when I can go into the classroom and the lights don't bother me at all, but there are also days when I just can't handle it. \r\n\r\nI have no idea how to solve this because sometimes when I ask the teacher to turn off some of the lights they refuse, because they need them for visibility. Other times they oblige and I feel much better. \r\n\r\nIt also makes me feel so guilty because there's another 30 people in the classroom with me and they probably prefer to have all the lights on. \r\n\r\nI had a terrible day today because during two of the lessons the lights bothered me too much. I was so upset the whole day and I didn't know what to do. I just suffered in silence and stimmed excessively. \r\n\r\nI really don't know how to solve this because it's such a niche problem.

Since then, my roommate, that I was assigned randomly, has told me things about him being jealous of me for having friends, because he claims to have none, and that he constantly thinks about killing himself. \r\n\r\nI barely know him. We rarely talk, and he started telling me these things very early on. \r\n\r\nI have called the emergency hotline him and I even made direct contact with his mom about my concern about him. \r\n\r\nBut the thing is, I talk about it to my friends, and think it\u2019s a huge burden for me to carry, and that I shouldn\u2019t be the one responsible for getting him all this help and support. \r\n\r\nTonight, my friends said that it is none of my business to tell other people that he\u2019s suicidal, and they think it\u2019s rude for me to tell them his business.

I think it\u2019s something highly inappropriate to be telling us, because we are no therapists or other mental health professional.\r\n\r\nI think we are justified in telling other people because this is a huge thing to be telling a practical stranger, and we need to release our stresses in life, but my friends were saying he\u2019s coming to me because \u201che feels security with me and trusts me\u201d. But I feel this isn\u2019t the case because I barely know him, and he tells my friends that\u2019s just shortly stop by at our dorm. I shouldn\u2019t be the person to determine whether he live or die. \r\n\r\nMy friends tell me that my perspective is likely distorted because of my sister, whom is bipolar and severely mentally ill and suicidal. I say that doesn\u2019t have much to do with it, he should not be telling me and my friends about this stuff, and if he does, we are free to feel uncomfortable with it. \r\n\r\nThe thing that annoys me the most is that they don\u2019t live with him, so they don\u2019t understand the situation. They think I\u2019m in the wrong solely because his is suicidal, but I don\u2019t think I am because it\u2019s a huge burden to put on someone to tell them these things, especially if you barely know them, and that I have full right to tell other people what he is saying to me because it makes me uncomfortable. It honestly seems like a bit of a threat to me because now I don\u2019t feel comfortable bringing friends over. \r\n\r\nThe thing is, I am no mental health professional, I am a 19 year old college student trying to get a degree, I obviously have enough stresses, with him, he has added to these stresses and I have called people (emergency hotline and his mom) to help him. But somehow my friends think I\u2019m doing bad by telling other people my issues about feeling uncomfortable about it all. They think I should do more for him, but I feel as though I shouldn\u2019t have that responsibility.",

Let\u2019s just say that \u201ccuriosity\u201d turned into something more. I couldn\u2019t get enough of this stuff. A \u201cSaturday night only\u201d thing turned into a weekend thing. Then, It turned into me smoking on school nights. From there, it\u2019s just gotten out of hand. Since 15, I\u2019ve taken 3 T breaks. That\u2019s it. With all this being said, I\u2019ve gotten myself stuck. Weed has ruined me. I used to be this fun, energetic kid filled with life and happiness. (It\u2019s kinda funny, I would always say to myself before all of this  \u201cwhy do people get sad? Just be happy\u201d). I found myself stoner friends that just encourage my weed addiction and vaping. I barely have any motivation anymore and the \u201canxiety of life,\u201d as they call it, is really getting to me. I\u2019m not happy with the person I\u2019ve become. Im scared for who I might become. I feel sluggish, brain dead, and unmotivated all the time. Weed has become me. And I feel if I keep staying on this road, it\u2019ll end me. Does anyone have any suggestions for quitting?",
        "answer": "That's tough, but the good news is that you're aware of it and looking for help. One suggestion I've heard from people who've successfully quit or reduced their weed use is finding alternative ways to manage stress and anxiety, whether that's through exercise, therapy, meditation, or anything else that works for you.\r  \r\n\r  \r\nAnother thing to consider is reaching out to a support group, like a 12-step program specifically for people trying to quit or reduce their weed consumption. They can provide a community of other people who are going through the same thing and offer accountability and support as you navigate this process.\r  \r\n\r  \r\nFinally, it might be worth trying some CBD products like [https://blondebud.com/product/cbd-cbg-tincture/](https://blondebud.com/product/cbd-cbg-tincture/) as a way to manage symptoms of anxiety or stress without the negative side effects of THC.

Before that, he was doing coke and ketamine quite often. Daily at some point. Eventually he opened up and told me he was struggling with addiction. It made me sad and I wanted to help. Fast forward to once we actually started dating. He claims he has been sober the entire time aside from two slip ups. One in august. One last weekend. I do not believe this at all and what makes it worse is that he becomes extremely defensive and angry when I tell him that. The reason I don\u2019t believe it is that for the entirety of our relationship, he is ALWAYS broke. No matter how much he works. For some background, I\u2019m the bread winner in our relationship and I pay all of the bills. He doesn\u2019t have to pay a thing. So for him to always be broke is very suspicious. His money basically disappears. Also, there are so many times where he\u2019ll be up all hours of the night into the early morning with the sniffles and ends up falling asleep with tissue in his nose. This is what led me to finding out he was doing coke last week. I looked around the room and within a minute of searching, found a coke straw in his empty cigarette box. Anyway, I do not believe that this was only one of two times he has slipped up since we got together. I\u2019ve just never really tried to bring it up even if I noticed signs. But I\u2019m getting upset about being lied to and I just want him to feel comfortable enough to be honest. What can I do?",
        "answer": "There is so much shame around addiction, it's difficult for him to be honest.  He's probably struggling with that. The only thing that would help him is unconditional love, that he feels secure that he won't be rejected for having this addiction. As long as he hides, he won't take responsability for his addiction. I say that as an addict in recovery that used to hide from my wife.   \r\nIf he can go beyond the shame, he may be able to look for help, therapy or support group, that's the only way out. You can show him the way by joining yourself an al-anon support groups, it's hard to deal on your own with an addicted partner. Have a look at /r/naranon/ too.",

        "question": "I (17, female) suspect that I might be autistic but my father doesn\u2019t believe me. What should I do? So for context, I have a complicated relationship with my father. He doesn\u2019t really know me that well and I didn\u2019t plan on opening up to him about me. He also studied psychology in the eighties (he\u2019s not a psychologist/psychiatrist though) which makes this problem more complicated than it already is.\r\n\r\nThis happened yesterday evening. I was talking to him about how stressful life is and somehow I thought it was a good idea to let him know that the therapist I went to for a short period of time thought I might be autistic and how I think it might be true. I don\u2019t know, I just felt trusting in that moment. I think I should\u2019ve kept my mouth shut.\r\n\r\nSo basically, he doesn\u2019t think I can be autistic for a number of reasons:\r\n\r\nFor starters, he doesn\u2019t like labels. He thinks that focusing on a label is bad. He also accused me of thinking that \"I think I know better than real professionals\u201c whether I\u2019m autistic or not just because I explained that I want to be taken seriously by doctors and that I would be disappointed if they just dismissed me because I have good grades and can live a \"normal\u201c life. He said that I focus on labeling myself too much and that therapy is more important than getting a diagnosis. I know that, and to be honest I don\u2019t get why he assumes that I only want the diagnosis and not get therapy after.\r\n\r\nThen, when I explained that I relate to all of the symptoms of autism he told me that that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean I am autistic. I get that, but how does that matter? Self diagnosis is the first step to getting a real diagnosis. I told him that I did all the self assessments on \"Embrace Autism\u201c and did a ton of research but he doesn\u2019t buy it. He seems to think that I am biased and chose my answers so that the test answers would say I\u2019m autistic. Furthermore, when I listed a few autistic traits that I exhibit he just said: \"That\u2019s normal, you inherited that from my family. I also do all of these things.\u201c He also blatantly ignored some of the other traits I mentioned, like not understanding sarcasm. We talked about my childhood briefly and I mentioned that I had a lot of special interests and unusual fixations, like my obsession with dinosaurs when I was five: I learned all of the Latin names, collected dinosaur figures, read all of the books, watched all of the documentaries etc. He simply told me that that was perfectly normal because \"he did that too as a child\u201c. \r\n\r\n\r\nAdditionally, he says that he met some autistic people during his time as a psychology student and that they were all severely autistic and \"not like me at all\u201c and that most autistic people have a lower than average iq- since I am a \"smart kid\u201c I can\u2019t be autistic apparently.\r\n\r\nI just want to be taken seriously for once. I know that I\u2019m not better than professionals and that I can\u2019t just \"decide\" that I\u2019m autistic. But I never once claimed to be autistic anyways, I literally just said \"After a great amount of research and self assessments and self reflection I think I might be autistic\u201c. I don\u2019t see the harm in that.\r\n\r\nMy father offered me to take a look at the list of my symptoms that I made.

Here are some stuff you can prepare in anticipation of a referral:\r\n\r\n\u2022 since it doesn\u2019t sounds like your dad will be of much help, find a relative (mum, grandparents, aunt, uncle) that you saw often when you were a kid. Cus autism assessements require that someone that watched you grow up tell the people evaluating you what you were like as a child. \r\n\r\n\u2022 get a hold of all your childhood medical records, if you have it, something that also records your developmental milestones. This is good to have as a whole when you\u2019re an adult, but especially important for an autism Assessement. It\u2019ll help the psychiatrist determine if you are autistic with or without a learning disability (what they used to call autistic or Asperger\u2019s)\r\n\r\n\u2022 don\u2019t listen to your dad and to his bs, if you feel you need to be evaluated, you will do it.

        "question": "Pros and cons of seeking a diagnosis as an adult Hi r/autism!\r\n\r\nI'm an elder with kids and grand-kids. Legally, I have reached the age where I have the right to be a retiree in my country, but I have told my employer that I will continue working (I'm a programmer) as long as I'm legally allowed, since programming is my number 1, 2, 3 (and so on) hobby in life.\r\n\r\nI've never really felt different than others in my entire life. Maybe I have felt from time to time that other people aren't really normal and have odd perception of things, super-human listening comprehension or very strange social norms.\r\n\r\nLast week, one of my grandchildren was diagnosed with (mild) Autism spectrum disorder.  I was extremely surprised and baffled. In my eyes, he was just normal. He was **just like me**. I've kept telling his parents for many years that they didn't need to worry one bit about autism, because obviously he was totally normal. In my eyes, it is perfectly normal to get angry beyond control when small things changes in life, or when someone interrupt you in what you are doing. Running away, hiding, closing yourself off and refusing to speak or interact with the world is the default human behavior when upset.\r\n\r\nI was **very surprised** to learn he *do in fact* have autism, to put it mildly. So this weekend I read on the medical information portal of my country about autism. And instead of recognizing **my grandson**, I recognized **myself**.\r\n\r\nThey listed about 25\\~ish common symptoms you may experience when you fall into the autism spectrum. I had a **strong** (or **extremely strong** in many cases) feeling of recognition of about 21 of the symptoms. I don't think I need to tell all my symptoms, as you can't diagnose me anyway. \r\n\r\nOver the weekend, I've talked with my wife, kids and my surviving siblings about this. No-one says they are surprised. Everyone has quietly assumed there was *something* different about me, but haven't really cared what. My wife confessed that she had a soul-to-soul conversation with my mother at my wedding, where my mother said that she had always suspected that I had Asperger syndrome or (mild) Autism, but that no-one else seemed to think that. She even sent me to a child psychiatrist when I was 7, but he shrugged it off and concluded I was normal as normal can be. Though, in hindsight, he didn't even speak my language, as I had just moved to a new country, so I have severe doubts about that conclusion... *(my parents where exiles and had a consultancy firm where they took 6 or 12 month assignments all over the world, so we moved to a new country once or twice per year)*\r\n\r\nNow that I think of it. It just all makes sense. But my question is, what are the pros and cons of seeking a diagnosis at my age? Is it even possible? \r\n\r\nI feel like I would want to know for sure. But at the same time, I'm afraid of what it means to me to learn that I'm \u2014 in fact \u2014 *not normal.* What would you advice me to do?",

They're being put on a performance improvement plan, despite the emails sounding factual and straightforward by my friend. \r\n\r\nThen last week, I had a discussion with my manager over a sentence I put in an email that he didn't like because I shouldn't be 'telling a manager what to do with their staff'. Their member of staff messed up big time, I had to clean up the mess, and came in the find something else wasn't done, so I explained and asked them 'please can you also discuss this with X person'.\r\n\r\nMy boss has said it's not rude or inappropriate, but that if I were to write something similar again it would be an issue. Apparently he would be annoyed to receive an email with something like that in it.\r\n\r\nI don't think it's rude, and I feel like it's being direct and clear. I expect others to be direct and clear with me, though they often aren't.\r\n\r\nI think if a manager is offended by a polite suggestion they are insecure. I have ADHD and suspect Autism (in the process of being diagnosed).\r\n\r\nSo here's my main question: how does one handle this disparity when an allistic/neurotypical person thinks something is rude but it's extremely subjective? I can't change who I am or how I think, and in this case the feedback doesn't make sense to me as something that needs to be changed.\r\n\r\nETA: I didn't realise I left the point hanging about my friend. The reason I included that was because it's making me feel that we're both misunderstood and this has only happened over the course of a few weeks and we've both been working there for at least a few years. So the discussion with my manager was even more upsetting to me and I'm not feeling that our workplace is particularly ND friendly.",
        "answer": "First.  Off. Not defending the boss here so dont come at me. \ud83d\ude07. Most bosses dont get boss training and deep down are a bit insecure. You are 100% right about that.They get triggered by anything that feels like insubordination.  Insubordination is a subjective term that just means that you didnt 100% defer to them.  They can call you insubordinate because of any reason they pick. A direct request is perceived to be an order which feels threatening to their ego.  So you gotta pussyfoot around these issues.  I Suggest. \u201cI just wanted to let yiu know I had this situation where blah blah happened/keeps happening and i could not finish the task you assigned me to do because this thing took up my time.  You werent here for me to ask so . Can you please LMK what I should do if thus happens again? \u201cSo. Your phrasing it as a polite question to them. That gives the boss the chance to DECIDE what do do.  Bosses love DECIDING. IT MAKES THEM FEEM LESS INSECURE.    And giving the boss a chance at advising YOU instead if you advising them.   Hth and dont hate me.",

        "question": "Therapist minimizes my experiences Hello everyone! So, I've been writing my therapist papers about my experience during childhood, (she says it's amazing and that it helps us discuss it). But we recently got into the page about how I stood out as a kid.\r\n\r\nIn the page I called myself \"the weird kid\" and my therapist immediately went \" Well, I don't think it's okay for you to say that about yourself\". I tried to explain how I see no problem with it since I was quite literally weird/odd.\r\n\r\nShe started telling how she doesn't even believe there is such a thing as \"normality\" and asked me to define \"normal\". \r\n\r\nI felt like my whole experience was just minimized, misunderstood, and mocked. I felt embarassed and wanted to cry as she kept telling me I'm \"just like everyone else\".\r\n\r\nHow can I explain to her that I, as an autistic person, am not \"normal\" by society's definition?\r\nHas anyone else experienced this, and if so, how did you deal with it?\r\n\r\n(For context I'm 16 and live in finland, and my therapist said she \"isn't specialised in autism/knows very little about autism\", and that her \"field is more in adhd\". My therapist is also neurotypical)",
        "answer": "God damn I typed a whole ass comment about my experience, went to google translate to search for 1 English word and the whole paragraph is gone. I am pissed. \r\n\r\n\r\nIt was something along the lines of:\r\n\r\nI am 20 years old and had troubles with myself and everything around me for about my whole damn life. Only a few months ago I realized I could be autistic. I educated myself extremely much on the topic \"autism\" and discovered that everything just makes so much sense now that I know what the concept of autism actually is. \r\n\r\nI took the first step to tell my mother about it and she was a bit skeptical, but also uneducated, so we talked about it and she started to understand it way more. I got full support and understanding from her after she got to learn more about autism. We took the 2nd step together to talk to my doctor, in the hope she would give me an appointment with a good psychiatrist. \r\n\r\nI wrote 6 pages about my childhood and teenage years, traits I had, school problems and bullying I recieved etc etc... \r\n\r\nAnd she was like \"your mom spoiled you too much, that's all, anyways here's a therapist you can go to, to \"cure\" your stress.\" \r\n\r\nShe also said \"define normal to me. Nobody is normal. Everyone has a few weird traits. Even my own husband says I am a bit weird. Bla bla bla\"\r\n\r\nThe therapist I got sent to charged \u20ac65 for a \"get to know each other\"- appointment which is suoer expensive. At the end of the session she said she doesn't know anything about autism and that I should go to therapy weekly for \"curing\" my stress issues. \u20ac65 is a lot for an unemployed person with medical issues (insulin resistance and gynecological problems with surgery ahead). \r\n\r\nMy mom was angry when we went to the doctor's office, demanding an appointment with a psychiatrist. The doctor was irritated and didn't like this, but against her will she gave me an appointment. I went, and he was a kind man. He told me that in a couple of months that a testing center for autism will contact contact me and I will have to go through psychological tests for 2 days straight. So yay. \r\n\r\nBut my doctor was a bitch for not helping me and showing resistance. She didn't want to \"label me\" as an autist. But she did want to \"label me\" as a spoiled brat, not because I have an attitude (because I am quiet and shy af) or because I am rude or whatever (cuz I'm simply not), but because I have orientation issues and my mom always drove me to school because I didn't know the way to anywhere. \r\n\r\nGod bless my mom for that. And f*ck my doctor for that.",

The sooner you get off it the better in my opinion. What I've learnt at 41 after six years of sobriety \ud83c\udf89 is that habit, is the main driving force in most addictions and is able to be changed by acknowledgement and planning. Change what you do after work. I started by making my bed in the morning and when I did it I told myself this was a day of change, I didn't have to do anything more that day but with potential to do more. soon I was doing it more and more often. And then in those days I could try other things like doing press ups or making my lunch. Habits can be changed with courage and pesistance. Tackling booze and having AFD's alcohol free days is a great goal but first get used to being able to see your behavioural patterns and effect them with change.\r\nGive yourself time, being aware of your behaviour and then being able to effect it takes time and you need to find your own motivation to want to affect it.

        "answer": "I was that kid - (heck I am that kid at 44). I have sleep anxiety - if I'm not falling sleep in a chair exhausted I can't sleep - I will get into bed and my mind will start racing. I used to have meltdowns over not being able to sleep because I felt so much guilt and pressure and it is cyclical. The worse I felt the more anxious I got and the harder it was to sleep. Adding in that I knew it made my parents mad only added to the pressure (they saw it as some intentional refusal to cooperate).I get at her age sleep is important but the more worked up she gets the less likely it is to happen. Using things to distract her will make it even worse because they are likely stimulating her even more by pushing \"cures\" on her.\r\n\r\nWhat helped me was I had a therapist break it down for me like this:\r\nHim: what happens if you don't sleep? \r\n\r\nMe: I'll be tired\r\n\r\nHim: Right but what happens aside from that?\r\n\r\nMe: I'll be grumpy\r\n\r\nHim: So? What else?\r\n\r\nMe: huh?\r\n\r\nHim: Will the world end if you don't sleep?\r\n\r\nMe: no\r\n\r\nHim: so you'll be tired and grumpy? But the world keeps going?\r\n\r\nMe: yeah\r\n\r\nHim: okay so if you're tired and grumpy what happens?\r\n\r\nMe: I'll be tired and grumpy\r\n\r\nHim: but you're already grumpy from trying to sleep anyway and isn't tired the goal?\r\n\r\nThat's when a light went off. It doesn't matter if I dont sleep. I will eventually. Sleep isn't one of those things where if you miss out you never get the opportunity again.\r\n\r\nWhat I'd do with her at this stage is on a Friday night (or any non-school night) tell her she doesn't have to sleep - remove that sense of doom. But make it clear at a specific time that it is quiet time (tell her way in advance - let her know the expectation) \"you don't have to sleep but at X o'clock you will need to pick a quiet activity\" (colouring/a puzzle - heck even if she zones out on cartoons as long as she's being quiet let her do it). Reinforce there is no pressure for her to sleep. She just can't wake any household members up. I get this will suck for whoever has to stay up with her but I'm sure having her meltdown already does suck. See how it goes and how she does the next day and if it works maybe make it a reward for her during the week.\r\n\r\nEdited for formatting",

Any time the teacher tried to add him to a table group he would make people so uncomfortable that he would just move back to his seat.

        "answer": " A little known tidbit of information, just because someone's brain works differently doesn't mean they can't be an asshole or wildly inappropriate. People are not angels because they have autism or ADHD. It is not a free-pass to be disrespectful or disregard other people's needs and desires, it's simply an explanation as to why they might not understand what they're doing. \r\n\r\nThe odds of someone's special interest being pornographic material of the specific race you are? I wouldn't buy that even if it were true. Sounds like a hormonal teenager to me who hasn't learned most people don't like leading a conversation with talking about porn. \r\n\r\nWe must all be careful with the term ableist because it can be abused in both directions. You are not ableist for being made uncomfortable by something that should make you uncomfortable. The fear of being marked ableist should never outweigh having your own boundaries with what you are comfortable with. Someone with autism is still capable of committing sexual assault.\r\n\r\nThe irony of autism is how many of us get frustrated at the idea of being forced to live in a world we can't conform to while also literally lacking the empathy that would enable us to understand why our own actions or behaviors may be frustrating to others.",

Hi all - I hope somebody can help us!\r\n\r\nMy 13 year old son has adhd and is diagnosed ASD. \r\n\r\nWe are having a lot of difficulty with him following rules. We fully accept that attitude, behaviour and social awareness are strongly affected, and he doesn\u2019t get chastised for these traits at all. \r\n\r\nBut when it comes to the rules of the house (of which there aren\u2019t many) he fights us. \r\nExamples - coming off the computer at 9pm for bedtime. Going in the shower once a day. Just little things mainly around self-care. \r\n\r\nHe often flat out refuses to the point of threatening a meltdown - \u201cyou\u2019re making me ANGRY!!!!\u201d. His meltdowns are ferocious, and we have a 3 year old (his sister) to look out for too. \r\n\r\nAbout 50% of the time he does these requests no problem. The other 50% is an argument. \r\n\r\nIf anyone can offer any advice as to how to get him to do these few things that would be great. We don\u2019t ask him to do a lot, and all the things we ask are around self-care for his benefit. \r\n\r\nThank you all!!!",
        "answer": "I can't give many specific suggestions but maybe talking about possible reasons for why he behaves as he does that might be helpful to you for finding solutions:  \r\nIt's very likely that at least some of these self care tasks are things that he finds overwhelming. Possibly due to sensory overload (ie. the feeling of streams of hot water hitting his skin then running down it, the feeling of the soap on his body). The inconsistency could very well be due to how much energy he has/how overwhelmed he's currently feeling and, if so, it's likely that he's already closer to a meltdown when he's refusing than when he does them. Finding ways to make these tasks less overwhelming may help. Allowing him more leeway in when he does them so he can do them when he's less stressed may also help.  \r\nHis age is a big factor. A 9pm bedtime is not something I would expect most 13 year olds, autistic or not, to handle well. Most teenagers naturally sleep and wake up substantially later than children and most adults and you should probably consider extending it later.  \r\n\r\n\r\nAdditionally all the hormone shifts, social pressure, etc of being a boy that age going to cause big variations in mood and greatly increase the stress on him (which is even worse when you're autistic).  \r\n\r\n\r\nIt's not going to be easy. 13-14 were the worst years for both my personal experience and my behavior.",

It's so addictive and people ignore it because it's \"a prescription that's good for you!!!!1!1!!\" No. It's terrible and it's ruined countless lives. \r\n\r\nThat ability to feel pleasure comes back. It takes time, of course, but it's worth it in the long run. I'm learning more about myself and my capabilities that I never thought I could have/do without Adderall. Your brain will recover with sobriety. I won't act like the withdrawal is easy. It's NOT. But if you tough it out, it's get better and better everyday from the last time you took it. \r\n\r\nIf you haven't gone yet come to r/stopspeeding. We are all going through/went through the same battle you are. It was my saving grace for me to tell my doctor I was abusing it, now I don't EVER have access to stimulants and I don't regret it a bit. \r\n\r\nHang in there. You're not alone in this battle. I know how you feel and there is a light at the end of the dark tunnel. Stay strong.\r\n\r\nAlso! Not trying to be a creep but I saw you like periphery. They're my legit favorite band ever. Being off Adderall has made me love and appreciate their music so much more.

        "question": "What are signs of flirting from someone with autism? Sorry for how long this is, but I want to provide as much context as possible.\r\n\r\nIm allistic and have been trying to flirt with this one guy who has previously mentioned he is on the spectrum. I know that social cues between us are gonna be slightly off and that one\u2019s version of flirting can be the other\u2019s version of disinterest and Vice versa. \r\n\r\nHe\u2019s very kept to himself and task driven- goes to class, does work, gets food, then goes back to his dorm, so I can\u2019t really compare him interacting with others outside of seeing him at class. Granted, I have gotten him to come out with me to parties or movie night with friends a couple of times. Even if it\u2019s not his style, he will come for 30 mins or even come just to be around us even if he isn\u2019t actively participating in the conversation, which I am very appreciative of him merely being there. I have been trying to figure out his special interests just so I get to hear him ramble, but other than that, I don't really know what else to do in term of flirting.\r\n\r\nThere have been a couple moments where I thought he could be flirting but realized it could also be just him being nice. A key example i always bring up is (context: we met through a mutual friend), when we found out we shared a lecture and he sat at the direct front while I sat at the 4th row. He always comes in with headphones so when I saw him I texted him to turn around. When he did I only waved and said hi, nothing else. He then proceded to pick up all his stuff and move it next to me and has stayed sitting next to me in class since, without me ever asking him to. He explained the first time I met him that he liked sitting up front to hear the professor, so it shocked me he would sacrifice that to sit next to me. \r\n\r\nAnother instance is that we also found out we walk the same direction after class, he goes to work in the building before my next lecture\u2019s. However, he always takes what I consider is the longer way to his work: the 1) entry that\u2019s across my building, but goes up a flight of stairs then down a flight of stairs vs the 2) entry we pass first which is on the exact floor (no stairs) but cuts our time together by a minute.\r\n\r\nMaybe I\u2019m reading to much into things, but that\u2019s why I\u2019m on here .\r\nI guess I just want yalls opinion on \r\n1) what you think of the situation \r\n2) what are signs of flirting from someone on the spectrum \r\n3) if I were to ask him out or try to flirt back, how should I go about it\r\n\r\nThank you <3\r\n\r\nEdit: idk if this matters, but both of us have never dated before. That's at least why I am kinda lost with it all. I have no experience with either NDs or NTs\r\n\r\nSmall update: while I am still figuring out exactly the right time to tell him straight up that I like him, I am being a little more forward with him now. Asked him out for lunch (not as a date, just going to the dining hall) and telling him his side profile is pretty. He did go out of his way to go to the dining hall I recommended even though he first showed disdain for it due to the distance, so that was really sweet. Let\u2019s see how this goes!\r\n\r\nLast update: [link](https://www.reddit.com/r/autism/comments/10za5dz/update_we_are_just_friends/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)\r\nTLDR: we are just friends, but that\u2019s ok :)",

I tried to confront my psychiatrist and ask him why he specifically diagnosed me with bipolar disorder and he didn\u2019t really have any specific reasons to support his decision. He kind of brushed me off and left it at that.

I\u2019m constantly reading and when I\u2019m not reading I\u2019m watching videos about people who talk about books. And then if I\u2019m not doing that, I\u2019m buying/collecting them.) \r\n\r\n* I try to practice speaking in specific tones before socializing and tend to go over hypothetical conversations in my head.\r\n\r\n* although I\u2019ve recently learned to make acquaintances and friends, I can never sustain them because I tend to choose to stay home because the idea of socializing, following social cues, and trying to figure out whatever someone else is thinking to be utterly exhausting. (Most of my friendships are either family or long standing friends who aren\u2019t offended by not having seen me in months or possibly longer than that.) (I have about a handful or less of friends.) \r\n\r\n* I feel like the only reason that I come across as \u201csociable\u201d is because I mirror the energy and idiosyncrasies of the person that I\u2019m speaking to and then feel exhausted afterwords \r\n\r\n* I struggle to make eye contact (to the point where I\u2019ve been separated by teachers and called out on it from a pretty young age.) \r\n\r\n* My uncle and cousin are on the spectrum.\r\n\r\n* I tend to take jokes literally and don\u2019t find things that most people find funny to be funny. \r\n\r\n* I\u2019m 27 and struggle to work at fast paced/social jobs and have had to quit. (I worked at Starbucks for about a week before I got so overwhelmed that I out burned-out and then proceeded to spiral into a state of depression.) Right now I\u2019m only able to participate in school part time and work part time (and that\u2019s pushing it.) \r\n\r\nI realize that these can overlap with several other personality/anxiety disorders but I just wanted to get a sense of thoughts and advice before I begin the battle of trying to communicate this towards a doctor. \r\n\r\nThanks so much for your advice and kindness \u2764\ufe0f\u200d\ud83e\ude79",

        "question": "My son is being ignored at school Hello, I've been following this subreddit for a while now after my son was diagnosed in 1st grade and I've also had an inkling that I may also be autistic. My son (8m) has always been a happy kid. Always enthusiastic about school and learning, especially playing with his friends. He's in 2nd grade now and here's where I'm seeking advice. Some days he'll come home from school and will say some kid said something mean to him. Usually when that happens I'll tell him,  \"Maybe they were having a bad day. Just give them some space and when they're ready to be friendly, they'll come and find you. You aren't what they say, you know you're smart and nice, don't let anyone's mean words ruin your day\". Usually that helps him.  Lately, he's not been wanting to get up and he's not his silly self as much. As a mom, it hurts a lot. He came home about a week ago and said a lot of kids were saying mean things to him.  I went straight to the teacher and asked if she knew anything and told her about the situation. She said my son never told her anything about it but she'll talk to the kids. My son came home and said she talked to them all and it put an end to it but now they're ignoring him.  This morning, I saw him walk to his classroom line and said hello and all the kids just left or turned away. He walked to the back of the line where he stayed alone until the teacher came to get her class. My son is sweet but I understand he can ask a million questions (which we work on) and he sets his boundaries pretty early on with anyone (importantly he doesn't like anyone getting into his personal space), he loves to talk about his special interests a lot, and he doesn't pick up on jokes and he gets frustrated at them (we try to help him with that as well). He doesn't pick up on social cues sometimes so it leads to him playing along when they mess with him or they sometimes take his stuff. He claims they're borrowing it but most of the time he never gets his supplies back. He'll say, \"They forgot it but it's OK mommy\", and eventually he'll forget about it too. Now I've made a rule to not let anyone take his school supplies. He tends to look at the brighter side of things and I love that about him.  His classmates continue to ignore him and I know I can't force them to like him and I'm not sure if it's worth mentioning it to the teacher because I'm not sure what she can really do about it. Growing up, I was always the weird kid. Nobody was my friend and I got bullied severely. I don't want that for my kid. He said we're best friends but I'm scared that I'm the only friend he has. I don't want him to feel bad about himself. How can I help him? What should I do or say? I feel like his personality is slowly changing because of this. I'm new to all of this. I'm trying to be there and be the mom I wish I had when I was a kid in his position but I would love some feedback. How should I go about this ?",
        "answer": "There's nothing the teacher can do. This is part of most of our shared narrative as autistic people. I had the illusion of friendship from people as long as I didn't mind my boundaries and did what people told me, but as soon as I realized they were taking advantage of me I told them to stop and they decided I was no fun any more. I had very few friends in school, and most of them didn't last very long, and the ones that did... weren't that healthy but I was so lonely I couldn't be dissuaded.\r\n\r\nSpeaking openheartedly, the best thing you can do for your son is to tell him that bad friends are worse than no friends, and that if they're not going to play nice with him that's their loss, not his. Be honest with him and say because of reasons beyond his control -- I don't know if you've told him about his diagnosis or not -- he's going to have a hard time making friends in life, but if he works hard at understanding people -- not just in general but individuals in specific -- the friends he does make will be lifelong companions who will put in the effort to be his friend in return. Tell him that you don't know how many people like that there are at this school, that those kinds of people are rare and far between, like shiny Pokemon, but that if he keeps his heart open and keeps looking for them, he'll eventually find them.\r\n\r\nBless.",

There are often too many sensory issues for me to sleep or relax. I can\u2019t stand textures on my feet. My feet have to be able to be cool (I now use cool packs), and uninhibited. My duvet was causing issues because when I put my foot out to be cool it had texture and I hated that.\r\n\r\nIf there is nothing medically wrong, perhaps there are sensory issues for her.

        "question": "Should two girls (7) be forced to always play with their friend (7F) who has autism? I work at an after-school club for 6-9 year olds and have been trying to navigate a difficult situation. These three girls would often play together but every now and then the autistic girl would come to one of the adults and say the others are excluding her. When we would ask them all why, the two girls would explain they sometimes want to play with just the two of them because the other girl will constantly follow them and has meltdowns if she doesn't get her way.\r\n\r\nI recognize that the reasons they don't want to play with her has to do with her autism, but I really don't know if it's beneficial for anyone involved to force it to happen when two of them really don't want it to. My manager thinks they should be forced, but my instinct says that this will lead to them getting more and more resentful of her and treating her badly when they play. The big issue though, is that these two girls are her only friends and she struggles to approach anyone else to make more friends. So if they don't play with her, she will just be completely alone. They do still play with her every day, just not always all day. \r\n\r\nI'm quite young and not very experienced with children, so I thought I'd ask this sub for advice. Should the two be forced to play with her? And how can I help this girl make more friends?",
        "answer": "Play should never be forced. If you compel the two neurotypical girls to play with the autistic girl, there's a high chance they'll resent her company more.\r\n\r\nIf you want to help the autistic girl make new playmates (or reconnect with the existing ones), then I suggest coming up with a cooperative group activity for all the children to join. Run your idea past the autistic girl first to make sure it's something she'll feel inclined to participate in.",

I don't know what to do Today my boss had a serious talk with me about the constant mistakes I keep making and how it's costing him money and he's losing customers and he's gonna have to fire me if it keeps happening. It's a really small business and my boss is a nice guy so I feel really guilty. This would be my 4th time getting fired in the past 2 years due to this type of thing. I have ADHD, autism and anxiety which makes work basically impossible, and extremely emotionally painful, but I have no choice, I need money to survive. I've been shit at every job I've ever had.\r\n\r\nI don't know what to do anymore, I feel like an idiot, everyone in all my jobs have treated me like I'm stupid.

        "answer": "This might sound bizarre but it worked for me often. I have the same thing, I know when I've got that itch and it felt inevitable (it isnt). I started trying to remove the emotion aspect to it and view it simply in terms of my brain and habit. Your brain has created neural networks that lead you to use whatever substance or activity. You have feelings of sadness, you use, feeling of happiness, you use, until eventually your brain feels hardwired to always use. But it isn't. When you get those urges, try not to panic or get angry or shamed or anything, try viewing it as a signal being shot through your head. The more you use, the more often you'll get those signals. If you view them in that sense I found I had way more power to ignore. And first I'd give myself 10 minutes to ignore, and by then the signals had passed and I didn't want to anymore. the more you can do that, the stronger you make the neural pathway of \"craving --> stay sober\" . And it builds on itself until your brain redirects more and more easily. At first there will probably be times that you will still follow through with using because it's so habitual at that point, but you can see it as a brain malfunction and not shame yourself \r\n\r\n\r\nAnd I'm not saying you aren't hurting, and that it's simply a bad habit. There are reasons we get to that point, but it's a hell of a lot easier to deal with them when you aren't stuck in the cycle of fucking over your brain and body",

        "answer": "Communication is so, so important--and so is self regulation. You did your part by asking her to let you know ahead of time when she's making food, and reminding her regularly is also helpful. I reccomend trying to work through the sensory overload on your own so that when you talk to her next it can be after recovering--trying to talk in the middle of an overload or meltdown will only be more stressful for you, and likely cause an argument since emotions are high and you're more likely to snap. When I get overloaded or sense a meltdown coming on, I take some time to myself and either let everything out or work on stabilizizing and calming myself down (of course thats not always possible, sometimes we just need to cry and stim and deal with everything until it goes away) and then return to my partner after I've recovered enough that we can talk about things calmly. If I try talking while overloaded, it rarely ever goes well and often leads to bad arguments. I highly reccomend taking space for yourself and communicating effectively afterwards!",

I can only cry when I'm too drunk to remember most of it, and the parts I do remember, I know it's a vicious cry - soaking face and clothes in my tears and snot kind of cry. But when I'm sober it feels like my emotions just keep boiling up inside me but never boil over. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPart if what keeps me attached to the alcohol is the ability to just get it out. To cry. To drunk text people the thoughts that have been eating me. I'm glad my drink of choice makes me Sappy because a lot of my drunk texts are just telling my friends how much I love them and how much I cherish their friendships.

I had almost exactly the same problem\u2026 I couldn\u2019t cry while sober and it felt so frustrating. I couldn\u2019t be lovey or show affection unless I had some drinks in me. I couldn\u2019t even thank someone or give a compliment. Definitely issues that stemmed back to a parent\u2019s alcoholism and irrational, erratic behavior. \r\n\r\nIt took me 6 months of being clean to actually be able to cry. But then, I swear, I started crying at almost anything\u2026 happy things, sad things, just feeling empathy for another person. I started being able to show people in my life that I was thankful for them. It was difficult but I felt like I needed to do it because I\u2019d always wanted to be able to show those people that I was grateful. \r\n\r\nI know it\u2019s excruciating, trust me, I do. But, somewhere along the way, you learned you weren\u2019t allowed to cry and now the only way you can is by ingesting a substance that takes down all your defenses \u2026but it\u2019s also ruining your life. If you stay off of it for long enough, you\u2019ll learn how to feel all those things naturally. It\u2019ll definitely feel awkward, but it\u2019ll be worth it to feel whole again without something that\u2019s leeching your finances, mental health, and relationships. \r\n\r\nAnd I don\u2019t know if this helps, but I don\u2019t really do 12-step. It didn\u2019t really work for me. I use a lot of principles from it and I may go again one day, but it\u2019s not how I got clean or got through my first year. \r\n\r\nGo check into a good rehab program and then find a good IOP program to do for a few months after that. (The rehab will definitely help you with that aftercare plan.) The friends I made in that program have been a really solid support for me these last 14 months. They say connection is the opposite of addiction, and i whole heartedly subscribe to that. \r\n\r\nI hope things get better for you. :)",

They thought I was just an anxious and chaotic person. My own parents don't believe I am autistic and didn't come to the appointment in which it was arranged for them to come in order to understand the details about my condition and diagnosis.\r\n\r\nI am worried that my psychiatrist was wrong for diagnosing me with autism, although my characteristics and traits are very obviously of one's who is on the spectrum and have been with me my whole life. He also explained and showed me the criteria and how they fit exactly with how I have been feeling and what I remember experiencing ever since I was a child.\r\n\r\nMy therapist was the one who noticed my autism first, after many months of visiting her, so I was able to kind of unmask as much as I could and recognise my traits. However, I didn't have a diagnosis from a psychiatrist so I thought I was just faking it. Now I have my autism diagnosed from a psychiatrist and I still doubt myself. That I mimicked autism because of my trauma while my trauma comes from the ways I've been treated due to my autism.\r\n\r\n I am worried that my condition isn't being taken seriously after that much evaluation. People are so quick to tell me I am too weird and rude and unlikeable for the ways my autism presents but still trivialise it in order to call me a faker\r\n\r\nHas anyone else have doubts about their diagnosis even if their autism has been something they have always found distressing?",

        "answer": "Congratulations! AA and ADHD dad of two (ages 8 and 11) here. I understand your fear, but it really is a positive that you know you\u2019re autistic - I wasn\u2019t diagnosed until three years ago. Knowing your diagnosis helps you put your own behavior and emotions in perspective, and can ideally help you adjust accordingly. First of all - just that you care enough to really be thinking about this and reach out here shows you\u2019re a caring thoughtful person. Secondly - you can\u2019t beat yourself up about what could or will happen as a parent. You\u2019re going to screw up, we all do. You\u2019re going to make mistakes, we all do. As someone who is on the spectrum, you\u2019re going to have meltdowns and moments when you\u2019re completely overwhelmed. That\u2019s ok! The key thing is to develop the skill of recognizing when you\u2019re in that state or approaching that disregulated state, and then taking a minute to remove yourself (physically or emotionally - even if just for a moment.) Of course that\u2019s not always possible with a small child, but I\u2019ve found that even just the act of recognizing that you\u2019re feeling disregulated or out of sorts, can help you feel better. Another key thing here - be sure to take care of yourself. Try to find moments or ways to meet your own emotional needs. Again, not always possible with a small child, but do try. Last thing - the beginning is always really tough. Just remember that whatever is happening when you\u2019re feeling at your worst (baby won\u2019t sleep, you\u2019ve been up for endless hours etc) - that won\u2019t last forever. In fact, time will soon fly by. So many people will tell you to cherish every moment, and you may want to punch them in the face at times. But you will look back and remember all the wonderful moments. And there will be so many wonderful moments. \r\n\r\nYou\u2019ll have bad days, but that\u2019s ok. You\u2019re going to be a great mom. You\u2019re going to have a great kid or kids. Again - congratulations!",

        "question": "I have a drug problem I\u2019m not really sure why I decided to come in here, but I feel like I really have no other place to go. I am 22M studying finance/marketing in college. I was adopted when I was a baby and my parents are quite successful. My mother owns a company and my father comes from a very successful European family. They both attended prestigious schools and expect nothing less from me or my older sister. My older sister is a former  5-star athlete and amazing student who has started her own company and is doing masters program in Europe. My grandfather invented a pretty famous product and my father inherited the patent when he was 14 because my grandfather passed away. My father never had a good relationship with his family, aside from his mother. My grandmother was the most amazing person in the world, but that\u2019s a different story. My mother comes from a successful Midwest family and has 8 siblings and our extended family is around 200 people. I am the youngest member of my family and needless to say I have a lot of eyes and pressure on me to be successful. I decided to go straight to college after hs but never really went to class, partied a lot and basically got myself kicked out. My parents were so mad and I ended up moving out of their house, living on my own and working full time first the first time to pay for all of my own stuff. I grew up a privileged childhood and I know I have taken so much for granted and this has put a tremendous strain on my relationships with my family. Growing up my parents never really said no except when it came to drugs and partying. I was never allowed to go to parties until late in hs and I was drug tested throughout hs. This didn\u2019t really stop me too much and I was in trouble a lot junior year. The only thing that was rally stopping me was that I was playimg on a high level soccer team and was being recruited to play at some smaller school. Unfortunately I got hit with a bunch of injuries and that halted my plans for college soccer. When I finally went to school I played for fin but definitely focused on just having. Fun. During the year that I left school, I started smoking weed and drinking a lot. I was working a construction/sales job and was making pretty decent money considering my situation. As the money started rolling in I started getting into cocaine. I was able to hide a lot of my stuff from my parents but I started selling carts and weed and my parents saw my bank transactions and called me out. They told me if I stop and get my shit together and do some online classes they would pay for me to go back to school. So I chilled out a bit and kept my head down and went back to school. That was 3 years ago. I have always had a big social circle and that has been by design. Do this day I\u2019m still not sure what is actually wrong with me, maybe I\u2019m a psychopath or just insanely arrogant but I have a reason for absolutely everthing I do. I make sure to plan my interactions, I choose words and leave out details in order to get stuff out of people. And it works. I don\u2019t know why or how, but I grew up in a upper middle class white family and even though I am brown, I have somehow been granted some version of classism/privilege. My sister is really the only one I talk to about this but she made the note that I one across as always laid back even when the world is burning. We\u2019ll in order to stop me from losing my mind, i have started really just self medicating. I have so many issues with my body, mostly from sports and working construction, but now I know it\u2019s other things too. About 2 years ago I decided I wanted to work out and get back into shape. I started lifting like 10 times a week going 2x a day and just non stop work. I ended up hopping on sarms and it allowed me to push my body to new limits. I\u2019m the end I got hurt because I would use the sarms to numb my body and I would smoke and take preworkout to  push though the pain. I was doing an summer internship at an investment firm and so my and the other interns were always doing adderal, Ritalin, or something to keep us focused. I then started getting back into coke after meeting a mutual friend at a party that deals. We ended up striking up a deal and I could get him into parties and he could sell. After the first few parties I brought him to I got a different kind of high. The high of having power. I can get into that later but basically fast forward to when school starts and me and my friends are buying 8bas every weekend doing a g and then selling the rest at parties. I started moving so much product for my guy that he was giving me free stuff just cuz he knew I would move it. Around this time I started getting into shrooms. I used them as an escape/reset when I was in a bad mental place or just had a lot going on. I have had some amazing experiences and some truly horrifying experiences (i can share) but I started microdosing a lot and would mix it with weed and cocaine. I started getting some crazy trips which led me to Molly, popper, concerta to name a few. I still don\u2019t want to get into anything stronger and acid scares the shit out of me. But basically I am at the point in my life where I am unable to sleep unless I am on something. I hate being with my own thoughts and I have started disassociated from certain things. I almost feel like I can\u2019t distinguish what is real and what is me being high or just overthinking. I cannot tell my family for a variety of reasons. Of course it would kill them and it would mess everthing up. But the other reason is because I have never been doing better from the outside looking in. I am currently in the last rounds of interviews for some big private equity and wealth management firms. I am still dealing and making good money, I live in a party house which has only made me more popular and crave the attention more. But at the same time I feel like I\u2019m stuck in a time loop. Every week is the same. I constantly relive memories. I don\u2019t remember doing school work and yet I am doing good in my classes. I just find time to grind stuff out and I basically just live for the weekend. The reason I\u2019m writing this is because I know that I am so close to losing it. I am currently in love with my best friend and I don\u2019t know how to tell her, I know if I keep doing this amount of drugs I will die, I know that I can\u2019t keep putting on fake smiles and pretending to like people. I have always been able to smile and be nice to people but recently I have felt myself become really mad or annoyed at absolutely nothing. But I have so many people telling me how good I\u2019m doing and how proud they are of me going back to school and landing a good internship. So  im not sure if anyone will actually see this or spend the time reading it, but I\u2019m open to anything. And I have lowkey lived a pretty crazy life and have a bunch of stories I can share.",

This also negatively affects Autistic men due to social awkwardness\r\n\r\n2) I\u2019ve noticed that most of the Autistic women I know irl who are in relationships are with NT men, likely at least partially due to point 1. I wish more Autistic women were open to dating Autistic men.\r\n\r\n3) Autistic AFAB individuals seem to be more likely to come out as trans, nonbinary, genderfluid, etc. which lowers the dating pool for Autistic men who are attracted to women.\r\n\r\n4) Autistics of all genders often prefer to focus our energy on our interests rather than our physical appearance, so we\u2019re often seen as less attractive than NTs\r\n\r\n5) there is very little infrastructure in place for Autistics to meet each other to form both romantic and platonic relationships.",

        "question": "Autism Diagnosis Results - Bad News Hey guys. \r\n\r\nI will omit my autistic traits, behaviours and sensory issues from this post. \r\n\r\nIn short I (26 m) finally after years of waiting have the results from an autism assessment (in the UK). \r\n\r\nSadly I was told I have many traits and I am on the threshold but because I dont have the social side of it I was not diagnosed autistic. \r\n\r\nThis is devastating. Because all through school, college, Uni my jobs I have had crazy anxiety, avoided all social situation, didnt make friends and went onto panic attack and anxiety meds to get through it. \r\n\r\nAfter going on the meds I started working on my eye contact, hand gestures and building up my tolerance to socialising without getting drained so quickly. \r\n\r\nHowever, it is all a mask. But because I have a job and have travelled I was told these are things autistic people struggle with and that also leant them towards not diagnosing me. \r\n\r\nI am gutted. I said to her if I went to every adult autism assessment centre in the UK do you believe 1 would diagnose me. She said without hesitation 'definately' and that each centre diagnoses differently. \r\n\r\nWhat would you guys do in this situation? I could go back to my gp and push for a second refferal and assessment. \r\n\r\nMy brother and cousin are both autistic and were diagnosed as adults. Both of whomb are shooketh I did not get the diagnosis. My mum works with SEN children mostly autistic children. She wishes she knew then what she knows now and would of sent me to get a diagnosis as a child. \r\n\r\nIts also tricky since I identify as autistic already. I was so sure I would be diagnosed. Just didnt realise I talked myself out of a diagnosis by saying I have a job and have travelled.\r\n\r\nAnyway. \r\n\r\nLooking for guidance. \r\n\r\nThank you all.",
        "answer": "From what I'm reading here, they told you that you meet most of the criteria but they couldn't diagnose you with autism because of a lack of a \"social component,\" but you have significant social challenges. It sounds like it's perfectly reasonable for you to question this diagnosis (or lack thereof).\r\n\r\nIf you feel your results don't accurately reflect your social challenges, maybe think back to the questions you were asked. Were there many ways to interpret these questions? Is it possible you answered in a way that reflected your external/masked appearance, rather than your internal experience? I can't be of much help here, as I was diagnosed 10 years ago and don't remember much about the experience. However, I'm happy to help you think through this if there's anything you remember from the process that seemed vague or anything like that.",

I\u2019ve known him since I was 14 (I\u2019m 23 now, we started dating when I turned 21) and he\u2019s always been one of those kids who smoked weed all the time then eventually that turned into taking percocets & xanax. He got in a long-term relationship and had 2 beautiful kids and stopped taking them. Around the time we started dating COVID had hit and he lost his job and he started taking them again. At first I didn\u2019t know, I thought he was just a really sleepy guy (lol). I never knew the signs. At some point we broke up, no contact at all. I found out from a mutual friend that he overdosed and went to rehab. We got back together shortly after. He ended up doing a 4 month jail stint, related to his drug use, in October and when we would talk on the phone it was the most coherent i\u2019ve ever heard him. Everyone was so proud of him and kept reminding him to keep up the good work when he got home. He even converted to Islam which I know to be a peaceful and disciplined religion. He got released on Jan 29th and I just found out a few days ago that he\u2019s been taking xanax again almost every day for the past week. I don\u2019t know what to do, I\u2019ve never experienced this first-hand. I feel like I have to babysit him to make sure he doesn\u2019t take anymore and OD. He\u2019s on 3 year probation and facing 10 years if he violates. I reminded him that even though he hasn\u2019t started getting drug tested yet it could happen any time then he\u2019s going to feds. He says he\u2019s ashamed, he couldn\u2019t fight the temptation. I love him but I can\u2019t stop my life to babysit him. I know he has to want it for himself but I begged & pleaded with him to stop and he said he would. Sometimes I wish I never even found out, I wish he hid it better and I could be blissfully unaware of it. I\u2019ve never been in this situation before but I\u2019ve asked him if he\u2019d go to NA or therapy and he said no. What will it take for him to stop? I thought he already hit his bottom.

My boyfriend (30m) has been using a variety of drugs since his early teens, and has been to AA/NA & rehab before we started dating a year and a half ago. His primary drug of choice is coke & alcohol, and his come downs are awful. His mood swings are all over the place, and when he gets angry it\u2019s explosive. He\u2019s definitely paranoid. His energy when he\u2019s not using is pretty much non-existent. He\u2019ll go days without showering bc he\u2019s so tired, and can\u2019t be counted on for any apartment responsibilities. He just \u201cdoesn\u2019t care\u201d about almost anything. If he\u2019s not working he has no motivation for anything except partying.\r\n\r\nFrom what I know, and have seen, he uses at least weekly. And when he gets going it\u2019s never a bump or two, it\u2019s a full bottle of whiskey and as much coke as he can handle. When he\u2019s not doing coke he will drink an entire bottle just to fall asleep.\r\n\r\nI will partake sometimes but mostly I smoke weed and drink on the weekends. I\u2019ve told him I\u2019d quite everything if that would help. We\u2019ve talked about him taking a break but when it comes down to it, he\u2019s barely slowing down. Much more than when we started dating but it\u2019s still pretty constant. He tries to compare his coke use to my daily marijuana use, and \r\nknow drug use is drug use, but to me a hit mid workday or before bed is just different from him staying up for 24+ hours and then sleeping for 13 hours to recover. I\u2019m worried about it. I\u2019m worried about what this is doing to his body and his mind. It\u2019s not sustainable.\r\n\r\nI just don\u2019t know where to start. He usually throws my weeds use in my face and cuts off the conversation. If anyone has been in his position before what should I stop doing? What would have been helpful?",
        "answer": "You can support him when he decides to take Recovery seriously, that's about it.\r\n\r\nYou can't make him quit or make him want to be sober, it's entirely on him to do that. The best you can do is set healthy boundaries. \r\n\r\nFor example, if I had a night of drinking I wasn't allowed to handle my son for bath time. It wasn't a punishment or anything, just a boundary my wife set for our families safety. But then I had to make the choice to drink and not spend time with my son.\r\n\r\nLook up support groups for friends and families of addicts. I like SMART Recovery, personally. I hate to say it, but it is likely your BF will get worse before he gets better. You can't rely on hope that he'll spontaneously want to get sober and your relationship will improve. That is generally not how these situations turn out... You have to take care of yourself, you can't be a parent to a full grown man who is an addict.\r\n\r\nGood luck",

From years of bad dental hygiene she has thick bleeding gums, and other related dental problems but is terrified of the dentist and doesn\u2019t floss due to the sensations. I really want to help her. Her biggest fear is getting teeth pulled and I know that if she carries on this way, her chances of getting teeth pulled are massively increased. I don\u2019t want her to have to go through that. she has also played with her fillings so much theyve broken off, this puts her at risk of infection and i worry for her. she wont let anyone look inside her mouth, even when shes spitting blood from teeth/gums. \r\n\r\nshe doesnt cope well with her head under water so she doesnt wash out shampoo/conditioner properly which has left her with dandruff and greasy hair, she also wont brush her hair - she lets me brush her hair when its wet though. \r\n\r\nshe doesnt often change her underwear/socks and sleeps in them. even though she has many clean ones.\r\n\r\nshe doesnt wear deoderant or clean herself daily so unless shes prompted to shower, she sweats and smells. \r\n\r\nevery time i try to gently address the topic she gets humiliated and goes mute.\r\n\r\nhow can i help her help herself? i love her so much but her hygiene is unpleasant, no matter how much love and understanding i have for her and the fact she struggles because of autism, its still unpleasant. thanks",

From here on whenever I adress women I mean NT women in particular.\r\n\r\n To me it feels like many women uses signals and body language and non-verbal communication much more than NT men. Am I right? I was wondering if anyone else experience this and how you think and what you do about it? Men say what they want directly and girls \"tests\" guys and do more \"game play\" no?\r\n\r\nThe reason for me asking is Ive always struggled with my dating life, and theres many things I need to work on that I know, but Im pretty sure one part of it is my challenges with social skills in general, and reading signals, body language and non-verbal communication in particular. Actually I might be very bad at using signals and non-verbal communication myself even. I am pretty bitter because Ive only faced rejections all my life, but Im not acting hateful or the like on women.\r\n\r\nWhen I approach girls they often seem confused, or uncomfortable.

I understand theres no manual for these things but I really think theres a few things or patterns I might not be aware about at all. I also think that yes, it can get easier trying to meet another autistic girl. \r\n\r\nThen theres this whole thing with feminism and how at least toxic femininity can be so double standard at times, that makes me even more confused, as to it feels like I cant approach women because theres always this risk of being called a creep or called out for harassment (like the unpopular gym video on TikTok).\r\n\r\nThanks alot",
        "answer": "I think (as an AFAB person myself) something you need to understand is that fear of violence and retaliation is something women/people seen as women live with. \r\n\r\nSo a lot of what looks like being non-direct and 'game playing' is really a person trying to let a man down easy/get out of a social interaction because they're afraid and because men can be very fragile in the ego department.\r\n\r\nAre there people who just ascribe to a weird gendered 'game playing' thing? Sure, but regardless of that person's gender it's best to stay clear of them.\r\n\r\nWhen you approach a woman she has no way to know who you are or which type of man you are. Are you going to get violent? Stalk her? She doesn't know. So she is guarded and some level of uncomfortable. \r\n\r\nThe other thing is that men sometimes act like any woman out in public and not obviously attached to a man is available for the taking/talking to. Nobody wants to feel like prey or one of those sushi dishes on a conveyor belt. Sometimes a woman is just out living her life/running errands/doing whatever and doesn't want to be bothered. A lot of public places aren't appropriate places to approach someone to try and get to know them/indicate romantic interest.\r\n\r\nIf you're just sort of approaching any woman you're attracted to and going for it, then you need to be prepared for the fact that you'll be treated as the potential threat and intrusion that you are. \r\n\r\nThere's no magic solution or psychology book that you can read to learn how to 'win' because women aren't prizes or games or math equations.

Once I told them I could feel the judgment in the air. \r\n\r\nSkip to the end, I get a call a week after my first day telling me to not return because issues came up and they all agreed I wasn\u2019t a good fit. I asked why and they said because I took someone\u2019s grapes from the break room (not true, the lpc was going around sharing them with everyone and she offered me one and I took that as kindness and said sure) and the other issue happened when the elderly volunteer kept talking about her grandchildren who have autism and how her other fiends think she could have it and I just sat and listened to her didn\u2019t say much. She also mentioned how when autistic children come in who have experienced abuse it can be very hard to get them to feel safe to open up and take time to bond with them. I agreed and said \u201cyea that makes sense\u201d. What was told to management was that I kept talking about autism to a volunteer and made the volunteer feel like I was being pushy :/ seriously I barely spoke at all. \r\n\r\nSo anyways. All that on my first day and no clients came in so I didn\u2019t even interact with anyone to show what I was capable of in that setting with children and families. When I got the call told them \u201cbut you never saw me interact with the children yet\u201d then they told me \u201cif this is how you treat adults imagine how you\u2019d treat vulnerable children\u201d \r\n\r\nThey were all fine with me socially to where I thought I was doing okay. So I keep wondering if me telling them about autism made them discriminate against me or if there was some small town issue where if I didn\u2019t fit perfectly in their social circle then they wouldn\u2019t want me there and they tied to find reasons to get me out. \r\n\r\nNow I don\u2019t feel like returning their crap because how do you go from saying so many positives about someone after an interview like how intuitive, smart, knowledgeable, and good hearted someone is to saying they don\u2019t belong in that field of work at all after only one day when they didn\u2019t even interact with the children or families. \r\n\r\nWhat do I do?  Return their things and say nothing or send them an email and try to get their reasons for letting me go in writing?",

Articles and such are usually about safe food and textures, but that isn\u2019t the issue. The situation has gotten very stressful for both me and my spouse (who are also both autistic). \r\n\r\nIt seems to only happen at night, never during the day. It\u2019s a rare occasion that it happened durning daylight hours. Tonight is a great example. We made grilled cheese and tomato soup. He usually loves that. It becomes some sort of battle. We\u2019ve tried being stern, gentle, rewarding. No method has been working. He\u2019ll start eating and then he\u2019ll pretend he hates it or that it\u2019s nasty. We make it the same way every time. It\u2019s like this with all foods. We buy the same brands, never switch them. \r\n\r\nIt gets to the point where we just ask him what he personally wants to eat, but once he has it the cycle repeats. Suddenly he hates it or it\u2019s nasty. It\u2019s worrying because we want him to eat, we want him to be healthy. There\u2019s been multiple times that we\u2019ve given up and he\u2019ll fall asleep but wake up in the middle of the night asking for food, he won\u2019t eat it and run a whole day off of 3-4 hours of sleep. \r\n\r\nMe and my spouse didn\u2019t have any major food troubles growing up so we can\u2019t go to our parents for advice.

        "question": "I am not okay I\u2019m a cocaine addict. I\u2019ve been addicted to it for over a year now, but honestly I\u2019ve been abusing any and every substance I\u2019ve ever come across since about 15-16 years old. This is just the hardest substance I\u2019ve become hooked on. \r\n\r\nThings got so bad over this last year (financially, health wise, mentally) that I had no choice, but to move back in with my parents. I\u2019ve been to rehab once before, but when I wanted to go again recently ( just before I moved in with my fam ) I couldn\u2019t find anyone to watch my big dog. He\u2019s a handful, a sweetheart, but just a lot to deal with. My mom is home most of the time, where as my dad is a trucker and is gone for a week or so at a time. With how my dog is there\u2019s just no way my mom could look after him on her own. So yeah, being broke, and not being able to go back to rehab, staying with them was really my only and best option. \r\n\r\nI\u2019ve been here a month, well a month tomorrow, and at first things were going great. I was able to stay clean for 4-5 days. Even though my mom and I have had a rough relationship through out most of my life she has been extremely supportive and understanding. Overall, my environment here with my family has been good, probably the best it\u2019s ever been since I was way younger. \r\n\r\nHowever, I started using again within the first week of being here, and I haven\u2019t told anyone in my family about it because I don\u2019t want to keep hurting them. I also am extremely grateful for everything they\u2019re doing for me right now, and I\u2019m just taking advantage of them by continuing to use when I\u2019m supposed to be getting sober. I don\u2019t even really understand why I keep choosing to do it. \r\n\r\nI\u2019ve only admitted this to my ex, who is still a really good friend of mine, but the constantly lying to my family is really eating me up inside. I don\u2019t know how to be honest with them about what I\u2019ve been doing, and because of that I keep using to avoid thinking about it or feeling all this guilt. \r\n\r\nI\u2019ve felt for awhile now that I\u2019m just not a very good person, because of the choices I make through out addiction. But I feel like I\u2019m getting worse and worse every day, to the point where I don\u2019t even know who I am anymore or how to start trying to be better. \r\n\r\nOne of the things that breaks my heart the most is that I know my mom either knows I\u2019m using still, or at least is noticing that something\u2019s not right with me. But she won\u2019t outright say it. Anytime she\u2019s called me out for it in the past I\u2019ve lashed out on her. I say awful things, put the blame on her or anything else besides me, or I just become completely defensive and end up leaving / cutting off communication with her. \r\n\r\nI feel so awful for doing this to her. And everyone else in my life. I\u2019ve lost and pushed away so many people in my life because I chose to keep using and what it\u2019s turned me into. \r\n\r\nTomorrow, I\u2019m supposed to be 1 month sober. I know that my moms going to praise me for it because it\u2019s been almost a year since I\u2019ve been a month sober (when I went to rehab). Most I\u2019ve been able to stay sober since then is just under 2 weeks. \r\n\r\nI don\u2019t really know the overall point of this ran, and I\u2019m sorry if this isn\u2019t the right place to post this. I just feel really lost right now, and I don\u2019t know how to get out of the mess I\u2019ve created.",

Things that are bad for you and those around you.\r\n\r\nYeah, you're in a mess and that is probably triggering your urges/cravings, which feeds further into bad choices, more messy life, more urges, etc.\r\n\r\nThis isn't unique to you. Every addict knows exactly where you are and what you're going through. You're never alone, no matter how much it feels that way.\r\n\r\nThe good news is that you can make different choices. You got yourself in this mess, and you can get yourself out.\r\n\r\nWe're only as sick as our secrets. You have to be honest with your mother. I suggest talking to a therapist about how to do that in a productive and safe way.\r\n\r\nThis is assuming you're ready to try to recovery. If you're not ready yet, you still might have more messes to deal with and things will likely get worse for you before they get better.\r\n\r\nYou aren't a bad person, and you need to be willing to forgive yourself.

Hello People\r\n\r\nI\u2019m a 30M in the UK and I\u2019ve felt for a good time now that\u2019s there\u2019s something not quite right about me in a social sense and I have no idea what it is.

There are certainly elements of autism that most people can relate to - you can be a socially awkward picky eater who doesn't like loud noises without any disorder whatsoever - but there are some screening tests available online (notably the RAADS-R and AQ test) that will give you an idea of if it's worth bringing up with a professional.\r\n\r\nThe diagnostic process in the UK is to ask your GP for a referral. You'll then be passed onto your local adult autism service for the assessment. As far as I am aware, the wait times depend heavily on the part of the country you live in, with different areas having massively different resource levels. For me, it took the best part of 2 years, from initial GP appointment to diagnosis.\r\n\r\nYou could always go private for shorter wait times, but if you're looking into getting work accommodations (something I highly recommend, even if you don't feel like you need them now) I have heard stories about people only accepting an NHS diagnosis.",

I just found something out that is weighing on me terribly out my dad. He (61M) recently had a massive stroke\u2014the majority of the damage was on his left brain. I\u2019m trying to stay hopeful about it but the doctors don\u2019t give me much hope. My dad was my families main provider, which consists of just me (24F), my mom (60F), and the dogs. I\u2019m trying to figure financials out right now and make sure we don\u2019t lose the house he worked his ass off for. My mom is beside herself so I\u2019m trying to do everything I can to help. This whole thing unraveled when I was trying to figure out where he rolled his 401k over to. He had changed jobs at the beginning of last year and I knew that this company didn\u2019t offer a 401k, so it had to have gone somewhere. \r\n\r\nI was scrolling through his bank statements and saw that he was withdrawing quite a bit of money at these two addresses that I ended up googling. Well, he was gambling again. It looked like he had started going to the two casinos nearby and playing FanDuel and what not in June of last year. When I was  younger, he had a really bad gambling addiction. To the point of almost losing everything. My parents almost separated but things worked out, we\u2019ve grown a lot as a family in the past ten years. He had worked so hard on himself to get better. He\u2019d gotten on some medication that really helped\u2014he has been severely depressed his entire life. I snooped too far into his phone and found that he downloaded BetterHelp in August of 2022. He was suicidal and looking for help with his gambling addiction. \r\n\r\nMy dad\u2019s addiction is something I hold a lot of guilt for because I know I should have talked to him about it. I\u2019m literally in graduate school, becoming a social worker. About a year or two ago, he and my mom had started going to casinos together again. They both knew I wasn\u2019t comfortable with the idea, I told them that he had an addiction like anything else\u2014you don\u2019t do them at all, not even in moderation. They didn\u2019t take it seriously. I know my mom didn\u2019t, even when I told her that I saw my dad playing an online casino game on his phone back in the beginning of January. She just said that he was making less with his new job\u2014I know see from his bank statement he was actually making more. I should\u2019ve confronted him. I wish I told him it was okay to talk to me, that I would\u2019ve helped him. There\u2019s so many things I wish I could go back and change :( \r\n\r\nI\u2019m afraid to tell my mom the extent of his addiction. I\u2019m also afraid to look further.

        "question": "Should I take my son out of ABA? This is going to be a long one but I\u2019m hoping to get some other opinions or ideas. My son is 2.5 and has been in ABA for about 3 months. I have never wanted him to be in ABA but it is also the only covered service to give him support beyond his speech therapy and OT for an hour bi monthly that didn\u2019t seem like enough for him. \r\n\r\nMy son has SIB (hitting head or hands against things) pretty rarely but it does happen. He dreads seeing other people out of the house. Sometimes he loves seeing people like some family members coming to the house but for the most part dreads public places. He\u2019s pretty much only been around his mom and dad most of his life. When he\u2019s in the comfort of his home without guests he\u2019s so happy and easy going and so much fun. We know he has sensory processing issues and gets frustrated very easily when out of his comfort zone. He\u2019s also non verbal but his dad and I can understand what he needs 80-90% of the time. \r\n\r\nOur reason for starting ABA was to help him get used to other people and work on communicating better (his speech therapist is old school and not the best. Hoping to find a new one soon). They\u2019re working on that in ABA but have made it clear that for insurance reasons and company policies he has to work on other goals. He\u2019s now working on puzzles, waving, touching his nose, using a hammer, not mouthing objects, clapping his hands, sorting shapes, stacking and sorting cups etc.\r\n\r\nWe absolutely don\u2019t care that our 2 year old can or can\u2019t do these things and I\u2019m not looking for anyone to tell my why those things are important. For my family, right now they\u2019re not important to us. We\u2019re getting tired of therapists coming to a kid that is getting used to new people (which was our original goal) but keep pissing him off by making him do ridiculous tasks to meet a goal quota. \r\n\r\nWith all that being said, has anyone had success with customizing ABA to help with the things he actually needs help with and not random other things that just end up upsetting him? Or should we just pull him out and stick with the bi monthly speech and OT? The only reason we\u2019re debating this is because the bi monthly sessions did not seem like enough support. Also he does seem to be doing better about being around people which is a big deal for him but I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s worth it to continue with the other stressful goals. \r\n\r\nOn a side note, I\u2019m already very reluctant to ABA therapy. This company is the only one I\u2019d moderately trust in our area and that\u2019s with me present for the entire sessions so looking for another ABA company isn\u2019t really something I\u2019m considering. \r\n\r\nTLDR: Has anyone had success with customizing ABA to get rid of stressful goals for your child and focus on what you actually want help with? Or should I just pull him out all together?",
        "answer": "I'm not going to give advice either way, as I don't have a child(although I am an early childhood educator) nor have I personally been in ABA. \r\n\r\nBut, I just want to put it into perspective that it sounds like you're *not* able to customize it at all. \r\n\r\nSo, I'm not sure other people having luck customizing goals with ABA would even be helpful for you as it seems the response was \"no\" for insurance reasons. \r\n\r\nP.s. Besides not mouthing objects(for illness concerns), which is a challenge for typically developing two-year-olds, I'm not sure why any of the other goals you listed would be a prioritized goal in the first place. I'm with you on that. Doesn't feel important.",

I know I\u2019m also a little bit worried that he won\u2019t be able to live independently (though this fear is likely unfounded) and that I don\u2019t know what his life will be like after I\u2019m gone.\r\n\r\nI think I have an outdated picture of autism.

He\u2019s really mechanically inclined and loves anything electronic. He has a circuit set and loves learning about how it works. He loves to read stories with me.

What do you enjoy doing in your free time? Do you have a job? Who do you live with? Do you have a romantic partner? Kids?",
        "answer": "Hi - I'm normally a chronic lurker, but I wanted to drop in with the experience of someone who's in their late 30s.\r\n\r\nI currently work in a civil service job that's quite well paid (i.e. I own my apartment and am financially stable). While my work seems boring to some of my friends (data management), I really enjoy the regularity of it and the fact that there are so many set processes to carry out. I live by myself at the moment, but have had relationships previously. I'm not interested in having kids personally, but have nieces and nephews who I really enjoy spending time with.\r\n\r\nIn the past, I didn't like being autistic - it led to me having a lot of social difficulties and I had a pretty miserable time as a teenager. I'd received a diagnosis as a child, which my parents decided was incorrect and pretty much ignored, save for speech therapy. This was extremely unhelpful on their part, and they only told me about the childhood diagnosis when I was diagnosed with autism again in my late 20s. I think with more supports I could have had an easier time as a child and teenager, because I spent so much of it being extremely distressed that I was so out of step with everyone around me. Even my 20s were a bit of a mess, because I kept trying and failing to 'fix' everything that I saw as wrong about myself. The diagnosis really helped me move forward from that point.\r\n\r\nAt the moment, I'm now at the point where I have strategies that generally work for me and let me manage relationships with other people and the world generally (I've been in therapy for about six years). Having my own apartment is also good for managing any sensory issues, since I'm in charge of my own space. I'm currently fairly neutral about having autism; it's just part of who I am, not something to be liked or disliked. It can be tiring for work though, since I have to mask pretty aggressively to fit into the workplace, but I try to take a few long periods of leave each year to relax a bit and avoid burnout.\r\n\r\nIn my free time I generally hang out with my friends and family, travel, and do things related to my special interests (box office numbers and marine life). I'm pretty happy with my life and how things are turning out and feel reasonably fulfilled. I have three people who I would consider best friends and a wider group of friends of about a dozen people, who I met via work, school and hobbies.\r\n\r\nI think your son having a parent who's looking into what having autism can be like and who already accepts him and his interests is going to be so helpful for him as he goes forward. Having that support and understanding from a parent can make a massive difference for quality of life and will help avoid a lot of the 'why am I like this' struggles that I faced until my second diagnosis. If he does end up still interested in machines and electronics when he's older, they're also industries where there's a lot more room for different personalities and ways of working (although hopefully by the time he's thinking about jobs and work, everywhere will be more accepting than it is now!).\r\n\r\nEdit: I should also say that I live in a country with universal healthcare and my work conditions include five weeks of paid time off a year (as well as additional sick leave on top of that), so I'm very fortunate to live where I do and benefit from all of that.",

I am currently in my mid-20s, and I was diagnosed with autism when I was 15-16 years old. I have a friend who doesn't have an autism diagnosis, and they think they are autistic. Although autism is more understood now, I strongly believe there is still a big issue with people struggling to get diagnosed. On the other hand, I also have seen a growing trend of autism and ADHD on TikTok and other social media.\r\n\r\nI have very mixed feelings about this friend because, in one sense, they could potentially genuinely be autistic and I'm just reading the situation completely wrong. However, all they talk about recently is how they are autistic with traditional autistic traits. They also started rocking back and forth in the chair and said that they were stimming. They also believe that nobody thinks they are autistic because they're too intelligent. Furthermore, they talk about autism being 'cute' and 'quirky'.The whole conversations were dominated by my friend talking about their potential autism. It has gotten to a point where im feeling a bit fustrated because they get all their information from TikTok, and they've never once asked me what it's like for me being autistic and how it effects me and my life as a diagnosed autistic person.\r\n\r\nDuring this, I interjected the conversation, and for the first time, I managed to get a word in on how my autism actually affects my life. I mentioned that as an almost non-verbal kid in school, it's taken a long time to feel more comfortable talking around people. They didn't acknowledge my comment and instantly started talking about how difficult things were them and was treating it almost like a one up from me, making it sound like their experiences and potential autism is a lot more valid than mine. I asked them if they would ever seek a diagnosis, and they responded that they were not going to because the process is too long.\r\n\r\nThe whole situation made me feel sad and uncomfortable as my friend treated my comment and experiences like they're not worth bringing to the conversation, and they had to one up me with their experiences. \r\n\r\nTD;LR \r\nWent out with an overbearing friend who is potentially following the TikTok autism and ADHD trend and doesn't acknowledge my experiences as a diagnosed autistic person.",

        "question": "How reliable are those online autism tests? I'm not really well informed on the subject so i wouldn't know. I'm asking because i've taken a few of them and they all say i have a high likelihood of being autistic. \r\n\r\nKinda of a shock since i'm starting college soon and this isn't something i've ever really thought about\r\nI mean it would explain a few things in my behavior, but idk i don't want to jump to conclusions\r\n\r\nAlso is neurodivergence genetic? Because my mother has dyscalculia and my brother has dyslexia.",
        "answer": "They're not really reliable. When you take a real autism test, the tester gives you a whole bunch of puzzles and questions and observes your behavior, reaction time, how you approach puzzles, how you recall information, etc. They're trying to see how your brain works.",

        "question": "A boy keeps bothering me at school and I can not handle it anymore So I'm not good at these posts, and I can't get any t useful advice from my parents or friends, but I go to a place for kids who struggle in mainstream since I'm autistic (high functioning) and had alot of issues at the main site. This place is a go-to for people with disabilities, mental illness, and who have bad home lives and I've made a lot of friends with people I really click with. I've been there since halfway through last year and this year we had a whole lot of new kids, one of them is a boy with low functioning autism, his mum comes to the school each day to keep an eye on him in classes, and I guess he's taken a liking to me. I'll try and keep this short but he talks to me CONSTANTLY everyday in class when I'm trying to work and all break. I can't understand what he's saying half the time, his breath smells horrid, and he bothers me so often that I've had major stress and been super tired lately because I get so overwhelmed by him. He's a super nice person but I want him to leave me alone because I can't handle it and even at home when I think about going to school tomorrow I get anxious and my body gets really tense and I want to literally cry because I know he's going to be non stop bothering me. He's super annoying too and I feel really horrible because he's nice and I feel like a hypocrite for being so rude since I'm also autistic and I feel abelist because I know he can't necessarily help it. Most of the time in class, I straight up ignore his presence when he (always) sits next to me so that he eventually stops talking. And at break I usually leave campus or hide out the back/bathroom because he always tries to find me. I feel bad about my treatment, but I try to put my well-being first to improve my mental health and I can't cope well at school because of him specifically, no matter how horrible that sounds, it's true. I want to communicate this with a case manager but I don't know how to without sounding ridiculous or straight up horrible. If you got to this point, sorry this was so long.",
        "answer": "You won't sound ridiculous or horrible. Just say \"he talks to me constantly, it's too much, I just want to be left alone sometimes\". That's perfectly reasonable. It would be better for him to learn not to do this, because he'll continue to push people away otherwise.",

The first specialist said they were going to push for a diagnosis in the report she was sending to the second person who I have an appointment with next week) and I think the way im feeling is probably linked to my likely pending official autism diagnosis.\r\n\r\nWhenever I go to my moms she will try and talk to me, what feels like non stop, the entire duration of the stay. I can't hold the conversation so she just keeps talking and talking doesn't stop. She tells me about every little thing that's gone on in her life, down to whether the delivery person who delivered an Amazon parcel did their job properly or the conversation she had with someone on a phone call to the landlords just to fill the void and not sit in silence.\r\n\r\nEvery time it just leaves me completely exhausted and the result is me not wanting to go see my mom. When I do go to see her, she just ends up getting upset that I don't want to talk to her. It isn't that I don't want to talk to her, I just don't have anything interesting to talk about, and she spends the entire time talking at me anyway so it doesn't give me much chance to add anything even if I wanted to. If I don't go, then she gets upset that I don't want to see her.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the day my mom is just lonely and I don't want to hurt her or upset her. Equally I am at the point where I dread going to see her.\r\n\r\nI don't really know what to do.\r\n\r\nFor info, my mom is aware of me seeing some people for autism but I don't really like going into detail with her on it as she tends to act weird about anything i tell her about and force her opinion on me (not just autism, about everything.)",

He spent his first six months  of his life in this daycare and then the pandemic happened and we kept him home with us until November of last year.

I talk to his teachers daily and aside from not wanting to nap they haven't stated that he is a problem for them specifically.\r\n\r\nI called and asked for clarification on what problems they were having and she said that he didn't engage with the other kids in group activities and that was a requirement of the class because he would get upset if she tried to force him to participate. This apparently came from her auditing the class and her experience not his teachers.\r\n\r\nI asked why it was important to force him to participate in activities he isn't interested in doing since he keeps to himself and doesn't hurt anyone by not joining in.\r\n\r\nNext thing I know I received and email saying he is being disenrolled for:\r\n\r\nNot looking her in the eyes when she talks to him.\r\n\r\nNot acknowledging when she calls his name. \r\n\r\nKnocking kids towers over during group play.

It's ideal if you can record without their knowledge because they may slip up and admit to something they shouldn't. If you don't live in one of those states, take detailed notes.\r\n\r\nTake time to familiarize yourself with the ADA and any local laws that may apply. *Especially* take time to familiarize yourself with the daycare's (and parent organization if applicable) policies and rules.\r\n\r\nGood luck, they seem very dodgy and I hope you're able to put a stop to this.",

I\u2019ve thought about wearing sunglasses but I don\u2019t want to look strange. I\u2019m considering dropping the class just because the sensory stimulation is so awful, but I really love the professor and content and want to stay.",
        "answer": "Wear suns glasses! Look strange! If you don\u2019t want to say light sensitivity and someone asks say you get bad migraines from the lights - the two are connected for me.",

        "question": "I'm such a pathetic addict My gf just broke up with me. This weekend I drank enough to  kill a horse, smoked, cheated, watched tons of porn, played video games for hours. I don't know why I am this way. I don't know anybody else who is such a crazy addict. It's my defing trait and everybody knows it. Anything I like I get addicted to it.i went to the strip club once than went two more times that month, I popped a pill last month and then went on a binge for weeks, I relapsed watching porn this week and watched it 4 times today, a girl showed some interest in me and I went home with her even though I'm in a relationship because I'm addicted to attention, she ended up being a total psycho and kinda traumatized me with certain behavior during sex. I'm even scared to actually ask you all for advice because improvement seems impossible. My grandfather, grandmother, mom, dad, uncle .. are all alcoholics and have allot of personality flaws. I feel like I'm the most aware of how toxic and bad the family is but I still can't break out. I started using when I was 14 or 15 and quickly went from weed to heroin( not a gateway drug my ass) I quit opiates and benzos a couple years ago but I relapse every 6 months or so.i moved out young which really enabled my addictions because I've been able to do whatever I want since I was 16/17. I pretty much forced my gf to break up with me by disappearing for days. Because she deserves better. She's actually great and if I was more mature I'd be gaurenteed to have a good future with her. She loves me and saw I was a straight a student and talented at my hobbies and jobs . But I am just so fucking messy and she can't handle it anymore. I do bad things but I know they are bad and they eat at me unlike other family members.ive fealt so icky all weekend since I cheated but I had allot of chances to stop.  I feel like now that I'm single I'm about to go down a really bad path. I have no self control at all and I'm scared to. I'm scared to live a life without all these constant vices and temptations. I don't even know what that would look like or how I could. I mean I can't even get an hour of sleep if I'm not absolutely trashed . Anyways I guess I'm just venting I'm really upset with myself right now.",

The disease of addiction takes control of us and makes us do things we would normally never even think of doing. Try out NA or AA, I think you\u2019ll get a lot of insight and love there.

Often feels like it's kind of pointless (although I know that's hiding the real fact that I'm anxious about it!) Now I try to ensure there's always a real reason to go out every day - however small it is. Concrete tasks to focus on really help me. It could be picking up a particular grocery item for dinner; dropping off a bag of donations; finishing the next chapter of my audiobook. I started selling stuff on eBay so I have to go to the post office a lot. Basically if I get outside every day then it doesn't feel so scary to do it again the next day, and the next.\r\n\r\nReally glad to hear your meds are working well so far too!

        "answer": "I had an issue with alcohol. I drank every day and could only limit myself by ordering Ubers as I received a double whiskey to force myself from drinking more, and that was rare. 95% of the time I drank to get drunk and if not drinking whiskey would knock back 4 9% Abv beers (equivalent to a 12 pack of bud) a night (150 lb at the time)\r\n\r\nI found aa didn\u2019t help me as I don\u2019t see viewing myself as powerless over it is helpful. I also don\u2019t see obsessing over something I\u2019m attempting to quit with nightly meetings as helpful. Quitting itself disproves powerlessness. \r\n\r\nThe biggest issue is that you\u2019ll now have a giant void that used to be filled with alcohol. But you will also have extra money and time. Use both of these things to learn skills that you\u2019ve always wanted to learn. Curious about woodworking? Build! Curious about an instrument? LEARN! Curious about cooking/baking?

(By the way, we don\u2019t live in the US, and social security is relatively good here.) \r\n\r\nI have accepted his situation for years, but lately realised how unfair this actually is. He thinks that I don\u2019t actually believe the seriousness of his depression and that I just find him is lazy. But he agrees that this is unfair and feels guilty about it.\r\n\r\nWhile I do believe he\u2019s depressed, I mean, I see it every day, I don\u2019t believe it\u2019s a good excuse for not working for years. I understand that after something traumatic you might not be able to work, but we are talking about years in his case.\r\n\r\nI don\u2019t feel good comparing, but I\u2019ve been just as depressed. Still, I\u2019ve worked, because I had to. Even in times after very traumatic experiences.\r\n\r\nHow can I help him, and us? What would alleviate his depression? He has tried meds, but none helped. He has therapy, but I don\u2019t even know if he has talked about this. To be honest, I don\u2019t think this issue is even on his mind. And also, I always give him affection, care, and support. \r\n\r\nAlso, is it unfair for him to not work? Is it unfair for me to ask/require him to work?",
        "answer": "Depression is and can be a debilitating disease and qualifies as a disability. It's a disease of the brain, a trauma or traumas. Part of what makes mental health so difficult is people don't feel like it's serious. Would you look at someone who is quadriplegic and say you don't think the injury to their spine is not a good excuse for not taking a walk? Or someone who has an intense fear of heights not an excuse to not become a utility lineman? Or had he lost his sight, \"How come you can't read your own menu?\"\r\n\r\nI'm not saying people never take advantage of it as laziness and depression can look similar to people. But that people *often* assume laziness or downplay the impacts of depression and anxiety. Mental health sufferers get a ton of ableism.\r\n\r\nAnd yeah there are days I struggle to even get up to take a piss. They're rare but they happen. \r\n\r\nOur brains are hurt and how that manifests is a spectrum. Hope he can find a therapist and medication combo that will at least get him to functional.  Its hard and some traumas never heal. I've had depression all my life to one degree or another.\r\n\r\nIf he enjoys reading you could try getting him a copy of *The Cure for Darkness*, it goes into a lot of science about depression and how it's treated both in terms of medically/psych but also by the wider community.",

        "question": "I can't attend college. I have no future. I guess the title is pretty self explanatory. All this work during my hellish school years seems to be all for nothing, as I'm incapable of doing the one thing it was all leading up to. It's kinda funny in a way. \r\n\r\nThe fact is I'm incompetent. I'm 16 years old yet I can't even take care of myself in the most basic ways. I am heavily dependent on other people. I've tried to work on it so hard, but nothing changes. I forget to eat, bathe, get dressed, go to the toilet until I'm in so much pain and someone reminds me \"Hey [Name] have you done [insert thing I probably should of done] today?\"\r\n\r\nI've tried alarms and stuff but it doesn't work. But that's not even the worst bit. I can't function properly in public on my own. And that's when I'm in secluded areas. My chest gets all tight and I have to grind my teeth constantly and listen to music and carry a special Teddy bear with me and control my breathing and  avoid everyone all while being on the brink of a meltdown and an anxiety attack. It sucks.\r\n\r\nCrowds are a no no. I got kicked outta school when I was 12 because I had a meltdown because of a crowd. I ended up in some alternative provision. There's 30 kids in total In my school. 30. And yet I still have to wear noise cancelling headphones constantly, and I can't go in classrooms with people who aren't my class, can't go in the lunch room, or I completely shut down. \r\n\r\nThat is, if I can force myself in there in the first place. Sometimes I struggle with my class, and there's like 5 people in there. Like damn. I am not very good with this socialising stuff. I can't look at people when they talk and I forget their names. Like it's not even just eye contact. I can't look at their faces. I get afraid to use people's names incase I get them wrong, and I never speak unless I'm directly spoken to.\r\n\r\nIt doesn't help that I go non verbal sometimes, especially when I'm stressed or anxious, which leads to a ton of misunderstandings. A teacher once yelled at me for playing silly little games and mucking about because I had a mini meltdown because my Teddy bear was taken away, (for context I bring that little sucker everywhere with me. I don't know why. It just feels safer when I hide my face in him and he smells safe.) And she put loud gunshots on the board. (Some war movie thing)\r\n\r\nAnd I asked her to turn it down and covered my ears (I couldn't take my hands off of my ears to put my headphones on, because of how loud it was and my hands automatically went straight to my ears) and she said it was gunshots it was gonna be loud. I cried a bit and it was embarrassing, and then next lesson, something was changed and I had a meltdown which caused me to go non verbal for nine hours straight, and cry continuously for seven. \r\n\r\nAnd about college, I gotta take a train. I mean, not to be stereotypical or anything, but I love trains. I think they're pretty cool. But I'm absolutely terrified of being on them. Especially alone. And the gap is horrifying. I don't know why but it's so scary to me. I once had a mini meltdown (what I mean by this is it was more like an internal meltdown. I didn't get violent or lose control I just sorta became unresponsive and non verbal,and panicked a lot, and pulled my hair, and rocked back and forth and stuff) in a train station because they were too loud. And my sister was there. \r\n\r\nMy point is I'm not gonna be able to do this. All my teachers agree that academically, I'm there, 100%. It's everywhere else I'm lacking. And I honestly don't know what to do. I'm not gonna be able to cope in the workplace either. And it fucking sucks because I'm barley functional. I'm supposed to be smart and only have 'mild' autism as people (people I know) call it.\r\n\r\nThe stress of the workplace is a no. I wouldn't be able to cope. I know this because I've been in work environments before, and even though I wasn't working, it was pretty damn stressful. I can't count in my head. Can't do basic multiplication. I can't even tie my shoe laces. Can't throw, can't balance, can't do anything. And sure, these things probably aren't all cuz of my autism. But they're still debilitating and worsened cuz of it.\r\n\r\nAnd now I'm sorta stuck. I can't work. Can't go to college. Can't do much of anything. I feel like I'm doomed to become the disappointment everyone thinks I'm gonna become. And it's not fucking fair. I have dreams. Shit I wanna do. But I can't. And please don't tell me its because I'm not trying. I truly am. It's just so hard, and there are things that I cannot do, no matter how hard I try. \r\n\r\nI try exposure therapy for my anxiety, I try to remember to do basic tasks, I spent a whole two weeks trying to learn how to tie my laces. I walk to school every day and i still react the same way to being outside alone. Heck, It took me almost three years of straight practice half an hour every day just to learn how to bounce a basket ball with one hand (my hand eye coordination is wack) everything is just so hard, and I don't know why. \r\n\r\nSorry for going on so much. I'm just so fed up. I'm described as incompetent a lot. I'm not good at many things. I struggle with almost everything, and I don't know what to do. What am I supposed to do in this situation?  And I know all of this isn't cuz of autism. Some of its just me, I think, but the autism makes it harder, and neurotypical people seldom understand that. \r\n\r\nAny advice would be appreciated. Please. I'm desperate at this point.\r\n\r\nThank you. Have a lovely day.\r\n\r\n[EDIT] thank you everyone for helping Me, I really, really appreciate all of your help and advice, it means a lot. I guess I've just been panicking a lot, because I've only got until May to make my final decision.",

Let me start with this is not a laziness issue or anything like that  \r\n\r\nWe've been married over 10 years and in that time, my wife has never been able to hold a conventional job for long and also be happy. Almost from day 1, the \u201droutine\u201d is what she describes as soul crushing and life sucking. This is to the point that she leaves the house on the verge of tears and won't even kiss me goodbye.  She is so down that you would think she lost someone yesterday but has to go to work. I should note that jobs have been office, retail, farmhand (horses), set hours, shift, and medical related. All sorts except factory work. She is very much the guy from \"Office Space\" but with depression to boot.  She does have PTSD. \r\n\r\nI have always told her that whatever she wants to do is fine with me so long as she is happy and paying her share of the bills but she only wants to work jobs that pay very little and wants to sell art.  \r\n\r\nShe is using medical cannabis grudgingly but refuses any other therapy or medication. (Xanax did help some, but she doesn't like how it makes her feel and her family has a history of addiction issues).\r\n\r\nShe does have a graduate degree and had no problem attending school but does not work in her field. \r\n\r\nI have been as supportive as I can but I can't continue. I need a partner, not a child. I am constantly stressed out and frustrated. I am cooking, cleaning, and working a full time job to give her decompression time to make it easier on her but nothing seems to make a difference.  It is really dragging me down like an anchor.  I can't be happy myself anymore.

I hated traditional work environments and referred to them as soul crushing also, but my issues were probably not as severe as you describe with your wife. \r\n\r\nI would highly recommend therapy, either single sessions or couples counseling. Not sure what her reasons are for refusing it, but it can be very helpful and therapeutic to air your stress and trauma and formulate constructive steps and strategies you each can take so your wife can live her life with more conviction and less worry. And whatever changes or steps forward she can take always remind her that you're proud of her form making those steps. You sound very supportive of her by trying to take a lot of the burden off of her and I hope you guys can find some balance and she can hopefully feel less uncomfortable in the future.

They identify as non binary but (and please don\u2019t hate me) they are functionally a cis man. They behave like a shitty entitled dude, and present in a masculine way in behavior and dress. I will use they/them pronouns for this person but in speech I often slip up. \r\n\r\nThey are in love with me and I do not, and never will, feel the same. We met on Grindr, but I was pretty explicit in that I only wanted friends with other queer people. They said this was perfectly fine and ok. We hung out for weeks. Turns out, the whole time we were friends, they thought we were dating. I cut off contact after that. When I cut them off, they really took it hard.\r\n\r\nFast forward five years later. I meet them again through a mutual friend. I think that since it has been so long, we can give another try at being friends. They\u2019re about to become homeless so after we talk for a few weeks, I offer to have them move in with me and my girlfriend. My girlfriend and I are poly, and I ask if that\u2019s ok with him since we sometimes have other partners over.\r\n\r\nTwo months later they move out. Why? They\u2019re pissed that me and my girlfriend are not having sexual relations with them. They said it was unfair to \u201cleave them out\u201d of a \u201cpolyamorous household.\u201d They say they \u201cnever would have consented to this.\u201d They act like we are violating their consent by not sleeping with them. We had to find a new room mate at short notice.\r\n\r\nWhen they moved out, they continued to send me love messages for weeks, and I felt extremely bad for them. When they moved out they made references to wanting to commit suicide out of loneliness. I did want to be their friend but the way they\u2019re treating me is extremely creepy and unwanted. This person is still messaging me.\r\n\r\nWhat should I do? Keep in mind this person is highly reactive, very emotional and idk what they\u2019re going to do to me if I am explicit in my rejection.

        "answer": "honestly, forget that this person is autistic for a minute. because this behavior has nothing to do with autism. they are being creepy and manipulative to you.\r\n\r\ni would honestly just ghost them everywhere. there's little point in confronting them because 1) they probably knows deep down that they're being creepy and 2) they'll probably flip it around on you somehow. that's what manipulative people are like. block all phone numbers and social media accounts associated with them. if they make new accounts and message you, don't respond just block. if they threaten su*cide again, don't respond but if you're generally worried they could be serious call emergency services to go check on them. in my experience, this kind of person won't take a hint until they realize you've completely removed yourself from their life.\r\n\r\nto me it just sounds like this is a pathetic person who can't take a hint, but you should also probably take some physical precautions. like if the locks haven't been changed since they moved out, they should be in case they ever copied the key.\r\n\r\nmy advice is pretty cold, i know it can be hard to just cut someone off. but, i'm autistic, so i'm not so good at the \"letting people down gently\" thing. imo protecting yourself is more important than trying to cater to a creep's feelings.",

        "question": "Rant/need advice/i think my mom is treating my meds as privileges and using them against me as revenge :( Ok first off i know the title is kinda loaded but let me give you a bit of context. I go by moss(16m/ftm) im trans, dyslexic and autistic (no official diagnosis yet, but working on it), but the only thing my mom might agree with in that statment is that im 16, nothing else. I've suffered a loooot with mental issues in the past altough it's much better now, but during that time i came out as trans which only made thigs worse as my parents are extremely transphobic , and only to make things worse i also developed tics which of course my mom doesn't believe :/. Now as you can imagine that would be a lot for a 13yr boy ||so i ended up in the hospital twice because swerslide attempts|| that's a little of background.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nNow. After a lot of seesions i started taking medicine to go to sleep which i very much depend on, whether it be for my mental health or school, and i also have a medication that sorta works as an SOS (because of my panic/anxeity attacks and meltdowns). Because of the reason i metion before i cannot be the one to manage my medication so my mom does it for me, she's suposed to hand me my sleep medication at 6pm everyday, she even told me to  remind her of it, and im suposed to also have 1 SOS with me at all times but nothing like that is happening. I've started noticing a pattern with my mom's behaviour and i have some solid theories for why they're happening:\r\n\r\n1st- I've noticed that my mom has been treating my meds as privileges or something that i can just live without. I need my sleeping meds at 6pm or else they'll take effect too late and i'll go to sleep at 12am and barely manage to wake up at 6am which causes a lot of stress cuz it just feels awful, if i took them at the right time i'd fall asleep around 8/9pm which would be awesome but yeah. And as you can expect this is really stressful so sometimes when my mom is late with the medication i go and tell her so she'll give me them, but it never works out, when i do that she starts saying stuff like \"watch your tone\" \"you need to be more nice to me\" \"im tired too\" and then she says that she'll give them to me soon BUT SHE GIVES ME THE MED AFTER A WHOLE HOUR AT LIKE 10PM??? anf then i get angry ofc and she starts scolding me, like tf? and this has turned into a huugeee habit now.\r\n\r\n2nd- with my SOS i usually dont have it with me cuz my mom never gives me one when i asked for it like i might be shaking in front of her crying my eyes out, begging for her to give me the SOS and she'll insted ask me what's wrong when i'm basically using all my strength to ask her for the SOS so i kinda give her a bad anwser becuase im so fucking vunerable and unstable. But then when i can actually thell her what's wrong like for example today this happens: me-\"well yk since there's the possiblity of me having asd there's this thing called over-\" mom-\"you dont have that. there's no doubt in my mind\" me\"let me continue- overstimulation that can be caused by social difficulties and stu-\" mom\"you never showed any signs.\" and it just goes one like that and then today was almost my breaking point cuz i was shaking so hard trying to not let the anxeity attack happen (it's happening but it hasn't exploded yet) i just give her the middle finger so she could take the sign because i was laready telling her to stop talking and that she wasn't helping but she kept going so i told her to get out, but she didn't so i just closed my eyes and covered my ears, then after 50 mins she finally gave me the SOS\r\n\r\nI'd like to clarify that in the specific situation up top i had taken my sleeping med and my mom was scared that the meds wouldn't act well toghter, but the reason i don't beleive that is because this is not the first time she has done this not with that reasoning, but she still deprived me of my meds for a long period of time where i was a danger to myself (considering that my last anxeity attack that i had (no med) almost ended super bad).\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nNow theories: \r\n\r\nEver since i came out of the closet my mom has basically resented me and treated me like i took somthing away from her, ever since then she tells me that im rude, bad, untrustworthy, liar, attention seeker and everything along those lines. she also loves to say that it's my fault that our relationship is falling apart and only my fault, she's forgetting that fact that her awnser to me coming out was so bad that i completly shut down and ended in the hospital and ever since then i can barely hug her. she also loves to say that she does EVERYTHINGG for me but i dont give her nothing in return :| but like she told me that giving gifst on holidays and hugging her more would be good so i gave her a gift on christmas and hugged her like a few times but then she kept saying the same stuff. So from that because of that i believe that this is her way of getting back to me. \r\n\r\nBut was really solified this for me was that when i was almost breaking cuz of my anxeity attack and was covering my ears cuz she was breaking my boundaries and saying stuff that hurt me when i told her to stop, she said \"if you dont stop that(covering your ears) im not giving you the SOS\" like, girl, tf? she was holding the SOS as some sort of \"reward\" for acting well.\r\n\r\n(she also took food 'privileges' away from me for a whole day cuz i couldn't eat the soup she made cuz of textures)\r\n\r\nIn conclusion i believe this looks pretty bad but i hope im just overreacting, i hope someone can tell me if im doing so and lend some advice? thanks in advace! :')\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nalso sorry for long text, and errors... this is a complicated situation.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n (im gonna say this now if you pull any kind of funny transphobic stuff in the comments you're getting blocked)",

Find the miserable bits, and shrink them. Regularly have a good think about what is making you happy, and what isn\u2019t, and try to just push a little bit towards the better life. Butting your head against the one-size-fits-all pre-packaged lifestyle and hoping for the best does not work.\r\n\r\nGod, the number of people I see who take a promotion for the extra money and better title and then spend a decade or two miserable\u2026\r\n\r\nFind your life! Not someone else\u2019s.\r\n\r\nA plant in stony soil doesn\u2019t shake its tiny leafy fists at the stones. It just grows its roots around them, looking for the good earth. I really think everyone\u2019s life is at least a little bit like that. And sure, some of us might have it harder, but it doesn\u2019t help to worry about \u201cfair\u201d, here. You are what you are, and it wouldn\u2019t help you one jot if everyone else\u2019s life was harder to match yours.\r\n\r\nIf you think about what \\*should\\* be, you\u2019ll make yourself miserable. Just try to look at what \\*is\\*, and make the best of it.\r\n\r\nThat\u2019s what I think. I\u2019ve been through it, and that\u2019s my lesson for what it\u2019s worth.\r\n\r\nI eventually found work I can do - immediate stuff, no planning or changing tasks involved: call centre work, and driving a bus.\r\n\r\nI can\u2019t think abut taking promotions or writing a book or making a board game or building the super-sweet app. Maybe it sucks that I can\u2019t do those things, but I can\u2019t. Trying to do those things makes me miserable. Choosing to let it go, to accept my limitations, has been amazing for my mental health.\r\n\r\nShould I feel embarrassed about hiding in my (pretty filthy) room because I\u2019m too overwhelmed to come out? Maybe? But what\u2019s the point? How about I just live my life as best I can.\r\n\r\nMy housemate for the past 5 years now is autistic. We\u2019re in very different places on the ol\u2019 spectrum. To my horror, turns out I\u2019m the clean one. He can only stick to the most rigid routine, while I can only get anything done if it\u2019s spur-of-the-moment. So he gets me: someone who puts out the bins, and intermittently does the bare minimum of cleaning to stop rats moving in. I get him: someone who is totally fine with me hiding in my room for days at a time, and who can be relied on to buy bread every single Thursday whether we need it or not. And we both get someone who will forgive massive hour-long infodumps about weird obsessions-of-the-month.\r\n\r\nI\u2019m late on my taxes. By 5 years. But there was one day late last year I was able to work the courage up to speak to them, and they\u2019re giving me an extension and waving the thousands of dollars in fines, and\u2026 hopefully I\u2019ll get to it any day now. Does that suck? Should I be ashamed? Maybe? But I\u2019m doing what I can and that\u2019s all I can do.\r\n\r\nI\u2019ve been homeless. I\u2019ve been unemployed for over a year, three times. I\u2019ve lost, god, at least half a dozen great jobs trying to find my niche. I\u2019ve spent literally years of my life thinking about ending it, every single day.\r\n\r\nBut I was married 12 years (10 of them really good). I have amazing kids. I finally found jobs I can do without going crazy. I have a good and happy life. I can wish it was better or easier or just \u201cnormal\u201d, whatever that is, but what\u2019s the point? **All I can do is what I can do.**\r\n\r\nI think if I\u2019d realised that sooner, embraced it, a lot of those really dark days would have been a lot brighter.\r\n\r\nSorry this is so long, but I hope it helps a bit.",

And idk if this story belongs in this subreddit but I figured I should post it somewhere. I'm also new to reddit so I don't know how things work yet. \r\n\r\n So, I had a mental breakdown at work... I'm autistic and things can set me off like snarky comments, yelling at me, stress, perfectionism, etc... For some more background, this was the third job I ever had and I'm a 20 year old male. The job was a dishwasher at a local restaurant and the kitchen manager was usually really nice. I always listened to her orders and was a relatively quick learner.\r\n\r\n  Onto the story. So I was doing dishes like usual and I was getting faster and I managed to get everything done before dinner rush. At first, everyone praised me. I started to take a dish that belonged to the front of the restaurant and my boss was the one to make a snarky comment saying \"that's the only dish you're bringing out to the front?\" In my defense, it was the only dish that was clean and able to go out to the front, and that's what set me in a downward spiral... Then people were on their phones and not working on the cooking line when I was trying to get by but they ignored me when I said \"behind\" so I had to say it loudly to get their attention... Then I'm being pulled in different ways to do things and I couldn't do two things at once. One of them was my boss saying \"You should get in the habit of peeling potatoes and portioning fries as soon as you get here.\" But the thing is, every time I arrive to work, the dishes and everything in that station is chaos so I have to catch up on dishes before I do anything else. Then when my boss told me that I need to reorganize pots, I did it aggressively because I snapped mentally... When I was done I started to cry... It was the end of the day and she pulled me aside and yelled at me. She then said that my behavior was unacceptable on how I was \"throwing pots around\" and apparently cornering someone while she was trying to talk to me, even though I never saw her in the kitchen. There were people in the way, but I told them that I was coming through and they moved. Then she aggressively told me that I shouldn't bother clocking out because she'll do it for me and to just go home... I texted her the next morning with a little help on what to say and she told me to call her. She then said that since it's January, things should be pretty slow and I'm no longer needed... All I did was aggressively take heavy pots down from the shelf, aggressively set them down and reorganized them, then set them back up. Then just scrub really hard on the dishes and kept muttering that everything must be perfect. Nothing was destroyed and no one was hurt during and after my fit. So AITA here?",

        "question": "I'm not sure how to deal with my autistic neighbor's behaviors So, just for reference, I'm also autistic, although most people don't know because I'm \"high functioning.\" I live in a \"townhouse\" type of apartment. Here's some relevant background info:\r\n\r\nMy upstairs neighbor is also autistic. He lives on his own, but his parents come to help him a few times a week as he can't drive. He is a freelancer, so he also has a website in which he identifies himself as an autistic artist, so this is how I know that he is autistic. He is extremely extremely social - to the point where I wonder if he was misdiagnosed as autistic and actually has Williams Syndrome. The entire town knows him because he is so social. He will walk down the street and stop at every shop to talk to whoever is inside. He has no fear or anxiety around these social interactions.\r\n\r\nHere's the scenario I'm dealing with atm:\r\n\r\nEver since I moved into my new apartment, my neighbor has constantly tried talk to me whenever he can. This was fine until it got to the point where I every time I open the door to leave my apartment or arrive back at my apartment after an outing, my neighbor runs out to \"greet me\" and try to talk to me. I mean every single time. The walls in my apartment are very thin, so he is hearing my front door opening and running down to greet me as fast as he can before I leave (and I can hear his running, too). Also, he must be watching out of his window to see when my car pulls into the parking lot because, whenever I come home from somewhere, he immediately opens his door (which across the street from mine) to stop and bombard me with his questions.\r\n\r\nIt all feels very weird to me and frankly, I don't want to talk to this person anymore. It almost seems like stalking or harassment, although I know he doesn't mean it that way. When I leave my apartment, I'm usually trying to get somewhere like work, and I am often running late. I don't have time for him.When I come home, I'm often just wanting to decompress in my apartment, and I just don't want to make small talk...I hate small talk... I never know what to do or how to answer. I'm extremely introverted. I try to answer whatever question he asks and get into my apartment or my car as quickly as I can.\r\n\r\nThe result of all of this is that I have anxiety about leaving or returning to my apartment because I know that I will have to deal with my neighbor. A couple of months ago, I told my neighbor that when he does this, it makes me very uncomfortable and makes me not want to leave my apartment. I told him to please stop \"greeting me\" whenever I leave or come home. He stopped doing it for about a month, but then restarted a few weeks ago.\r\n\r\nIt would be different if I occasionally ran into my neighbor by chance. But these encounters aren't happening by chance. He's even make excuses to get me to open my door lately, like picking up amazon packages outside of my door, knocking on my door (to get me to open the door) to inform me that they're there, and then trying to take the conversation somewhere else. I don't need him to do that for me, and I don't want him to do that.\r\n\r\nI just don't know what to do anymore. I don't want to make him feel bad because he's clearly trying to be friends with me...but I'm not interested in being friends with him. How can I make this stop?",

When you first meet him you wouldn't know he was neurodivergent, he just reads as like a cool guy that doesn't talk too much and you cant read him at all. but after his mom told me he was on the spectrum some things just clicked. his excessive spending on hobbies, his monotone voice, and his overall lack of expression suddenly had an actual explanation. i mean i dont really care what he spends his money on, but the monotone voice and just how he has chronic bored face has been eating me up inside. he just seems like hes never enthusiastic and i have bad anxiety so i automatically think hes mad at me or he think im annoying and stuff. its crazy cuz over text he is so expressive! is there any ways we can like cope with this? i cant think if a good word. like any way we can work around this so i dont have to be worried all the time and he doesnt feel bad for something he cant control. so far i've jus been going to the bathroom and texting him asking if hes mad at me. thank you for taking time to read!",
        "answer": "First off, hats off to you for being self aware enough to know that your emotions, especially in this particular scenario, are your responsibility. That is huge. A lot of people much older than you never learn this simple truth. \r\n\r\nYou know the things that are triggering you are not your boyfriend's fault, because you know he isn't doing those things on purpose. But you feel what you feel nonetheless. This advice may be too far out there for you, but try first and foremost to take several deep breaths and then accept what you feel. While the explanations we give for why we feel the way we do are not always valid, the feelings themselves are. So take the mental position of welcoming what you feel. Then move onto noticing and then questioning the truthfulness of the thoughts swirling in your mind whenever you feel triggered. For instance, you start thinking he's mad at you. Simply ask yourself if that's really true and if so, how do you know. Interrogate yourself. Gently, and with kindness, because you are doing the best you can. Play around with alternative explanations, like maybe he's not mad or maybe you can't read his mind or maybe he's content, etc.\r\n\r\nLike I said, this advice may be too esoteric for you. But that is what I'd do if I were in your shoes.",

        "question": "Struggling to stop using cocaine, could use some support I had done coke a few times before at parties etc when offered, but last summer I started buying my own. At first it was purely recreational, I liked feeling more confident and going out to dance with a bag in my pocket. Mostly weekends, sometimes I'd get a bag and go out on a weeknight, and it'd last me a couple of days. \r\n\r\nWell fast forward a couple of months, and it started catching up with me. Tired all the time, depressed, no motivation, work performance slipping. That was the tipping point where I should have stopped. Instead, I started bringing it to work, where I'd dip out of the office every hour or so for bumps in the bathroom. I was basically self medicating my ADHD with coke instead of Adderall. \r\n\r\nOf course, I didn't stop using when the work day ended. I'd get home, go to the bar and make conversation with strangers in between trips to the bathroom.\r\n\r\nThat was back in September. I've been going through a gram a day for about 4 months now, and I'm paying the price. I really want to stop, but during the week I'm afraid I won't be able to function at work, and when the weekend rolls around I just wind up partying again.\r\n\r\nIm thinking of taking a personal day this Friday, deleting my dealers number and taking the long weekend to jump start my recovery. I'm going to delete my dealer's number, try my best to go to the gym or at least do some walking outside, pick some comfort movies to watch - if you want to drop any more tips I'd be grateful.\r\n\r\nMuch love to you all!",
        "answer": "Hi there. What a deja vu. I\u2019ve seen this movie and I know how it ends\u2026 \r\n\r\nIn my case it was 2016. I was at the same spot\u2026 In a span of two weeks, work got so stressful, I did so much coke one night that I could not get out of my room next morning. Had to call in sick. And again. And again. I lost control. I lost the job. \r\n\r\nCocaine addiction can escalate pretty fast. I spent about two years (2015/2016) in heavy addiction. I mean heavy. Four day benders. Almost oded a few times. Nothing made me stop, until I lost my job and it hit me in the face.\r\n\r\nI tried to quit on my own for a while, I spent three months in bed eating and sleeping and fighting the urge to go out and buy more. Then I had a nasty relapse. I only got the grip on recovery when I started seeing a therapist. She helped me get my life back on track.\r\n\r\nSo my tip, from someone that has been in the ups and downs of coke recovery since 2016, is get professional help. Go to a group or get a therapist, or a doctor. It\u2019s so much easier and effective when you have someone guiding you. \r\n\r\nBe patient and be strong. It took me several months to stop shaking and feeling dizzy out of the blue. I felt numb and stuck for a long time, until I started going on long morning walks, that really changed everything. Go to bed early, try to go for walks in the sun, lots of sun, eat heathy (but keep ice cream in hand, ice cream is wonderful to cut the cravings) and keep busy during the day. Keep so busy that when party time comes you are so tired, all you want is a good night sleep. You will thank yourself in the morning.\r\n\r\nAlso I had to change all of my friends. I only felt really free from coke in 2021. I almost slipped back during 2020\u2026 Had to let go of all my party people. Up until this day, I don\u2019t trust myself around coke, so I avoid people and places where I know there will be blow.  \r\n\r\nThe hardest thing you already did, that is admitting you have a problem. You can do this. Trust me, it\u2019s worth it. Life is so much better without cocaine. \r\n\r\nGood luck!!",

        "answer": "That is something you have to admit truthfully to yourself. As someone who works with addicts, and is personally affected by life with an addict-there is no point in others telling you you have a problem. You have to find that truth in yourself and admit that you are powerless over cocaine. Being powerless doesn't mean you can't quit, it means you know that one is too many, and a thousand is never enough. If you can't put it down, and one line is never enough, you know you don't have power over cocaine, cocaine has power over you. If you feel this is true, then there is hope and there is an answer-sobriety. \r\n\r\nLife without that cocaine can be beautiful, and the cocaine use does not dictate a good time. You do. Your body, mind, finances, social life and future will all be destroyed if you keep on this path. You deserve a good life, you deserve to be happy, and you deserve freedom. I have had unsuccessful resuscitation of patients who went into cardiac arrest from use alone, or from patients who had their cocaine cut with fentanyl or other harmful tranquilizers. Every addict thinks-its not going to happen to them. That they're the exception. Please take care of yourself, there's a good world out there. It deserves you in it.",

        "answer": "Hi, there. Fellow coke addict here.\r\n\r\nWhen I first tried to quit coke, after a few years of heavy abuse, I managed to get three months clean, and when I was feeling better I started yoga. I felt so good and so happy about it! Guess what? I relapsed hard. Got a few more months clean, was feeling so happy, relapsed.\r\n\r\nWhen I finally decided to get help, one of the first things I learned in therapy is that an addict\u2019s comfort zone is down the hole. Our minds tricks us into not accepting happiness, like if we don\u2019t deserve it. It\u2019s a mix of guilty and fear and self-sabotage. So you have tools in therapy to reset this behavior and go back to \u201cnormal\u201d.\r\n\r\nTo me it was a long process of learning to love myself, to love and cherish my life, my family, my friends, my work, my clients\u2026 I used coke as an escape from some really bad depression and self-destructive behaviors I had long before cocaine entered my life\u2026 I sabotaged myself in other ways, with over drinking, always feeling defensive and criticized, always angry and jealous, having meaningless one-night stands with strangers\u2026 When I tried coke it made me feel awesome and sexy and dangerous and edgy\u2026 Wow, it was the recipe for disaster and I was instantly hooked.\r\n\r\nFast-forward to rock bottom loosing a job and almost dying, I go to therapy and learn all this awful things about myself I wasn\u2019t aware before.   \r\n\r\nMy point is: if you really want to quit, get some professional help. A good therapist can help you discover your triggers, your motives and how to break this pattern.\r\n\r\nMy tools have been routine, creating good new habits, getting close to nature and sunlight, and gratitude. Be grateful. Take a look around, pay attention to all this good moments and people you say you missed, and tell yourself you deserve it. You deserve this happiness, you deserve your job, you deserve this guy you like, you deserve your your family and friends. Convince yourself how important you are to them, and how they want you to be there, and you will be your best self to be there for them and to cherish this moments.\r\n\r\nRecovery can be painful, therapy can be painful, but it really pays off. Of course life is not perfect and there will be bad days when you feel defeated and tempted to go down the hole again, but there\u2019s a point you can reach when you identify the exact moment you want to self-sabotage and you go for a walk or have an ice-cream instead of stuffing your face in blow.\r\n\r\nUse this moment of venting to take control of your life, you have the right motivation! \r\n\r\nTake care and good luck!",

This is a small, close group and I\u2019m very comfortable with everyone there. We start at 1 and can go to 3-5.\r\n\r\nThe problem is the entire day before the session, sometimes bleeding into the day before too, I feel extremely anxious and overwhelmed. I get super irritated and snappy. This is super odd because I want to play DND and I shouldn\u2019t be this anxious. I can\u2019t really describe what I feel then, only that it\u2019s very intense and extreme. \r\n\r\nI also crash immediately after the session is done and can\u2019t really do anything for the rest of the day, even if I enjoyed my time playing. \r\n\r\nI\u2019m wondering if anyone has experienced something like this and if there\u2019s any explanation that can help me figure out what\u2019s happening.\r\n\r\nEdit: after talking with my wife, I realized that the feeling is like going to my law school classes, if that helps.

I don\u2019t have close friends to hang out with, I don\u2019t have people I don\u2019t to on a daily basis, I feel like I\u2019m someone who is not really missed or cared for by peers. Sometimes it seems like no one cares to associate themselves with me. \r\n\r\nI feel isolated. I feel as if I don\u2019t have anywhere to turn. Feel like I have no one to talk to. \r\n\r\nI\u2019m predominantly lonely in my romantic life. I don\u2019t have hope I will have anyone, it seems too good to be true. I put myself in this predicament. My one relationship that I can\u2019t break is pornography. At this point, now I\u2019m just going to pornography to fulfill the bodily pleasures I have, but to fulfill the loneliness I have. The sad thing is, I know it\u2019s the very relationship with pornography that has caused me to be lonely, caused me to seek out strangers on anonymous chat forums, caused me to go out less and become antisocial; caused me to become depressed, less motivated, anxious, stressed, dependent on pleasure, empty, calloused, broken, ashamed. \r\n\r\nI feel I can\u2019t produce healthy relationships, friendly or romantic. My focus of romantic relationships become solely based on physical intimacy, not necessarily sexual, but touching and feeling through hugs, holding of hands. I know relationships are much more than that and certainly much deeper on an emotional and spiritual level than physical. \r\n\r\nPornography has warped my view on others, myself, relationships, reality. It has helped me to isolate myself, develop trust issues, become broken and breaking others, distort my thinking, pervert my thoughts; prevented me to succeed and live a healthy, proactive life. \r\n\r\nI hate myself. I hate my lifestyle. After doing something for so long, you\u2019re so used to it, that though you despise it, you can\u2019t seem to break it out of comfort. \r\n\r\nPeople can recognize drug addicts, alcoholics; any sort of addictive behavior.

        "question": "Homemade Weighted Blanket I'm not autistic myself, but I thought people here might benefit from this tip. Weighted blankets are expensive and can be hard to come across, so years ago my mom made me one out of an extra duvet cover we had. She sewed long columns, filled each with some weighted filling, sewed a row closed, and repeat until it's a bunch of squares with equal filling. If that makes any sense. \r\n\r\nI'm sure theres videos and tutorials on that part, but the thing I thought was really brilliant was the weighted filling. We didnt want to buy the stuff they use in real weighted blankets because it was expensive and shipping was super expensive, so we brainstormed for a few days and guys. FISH ROCKS!! Or aquarium gravel, I think it's actually called. It's way cheaper and, unlike other rocks or heavy small things, it needs to be smooth and without any sharp edges for the safety of the fish. \r\n\r\nDisclaimer: This wont work for everyone, especially if you have sensitivity to noise. This blanket doubled as a maraca. On the other hand, if you're sensitive to overheating then it's a million times better than the store bought weighted blanket I have now. It was never too hot and it was such a blessing on hot nights because I didnt have to have multiple hot blankets just to get some nice weight.\r\n\r\nTL;DR: Aquarium gravel is smooth, heavy, and cheap filling for a homemade weighted blanket if you don't mind that it's a bit louder than a regular one.",

I like how it makes me feel dizzy and relaxed. \r\nthe largest amount I took was 3 pills (3mg each). recently I've been using it almost every day (usually just 1) or every night so I can sleep without waking up multiple times. \r\nI'm careful not to mix it with alcohol or energy drinks (I did that one time and it was really bad) but I do smoke cigarettes daily.\r\n\r\nsymptoms I noticed when I skip taking it:\r\nfast and strong heartbeat (sometimes it feels like my heart stops for a moment and my breathing too, and then it goes back to normal or just beats really hard), feeling nervous, anxious, light-headedness (sometimes), fast breathing and panicking because I'm not sure if I'm about to have a heart attack or faint or it's just anxiety.

I have several other accommodations (they don\u2019t really help, but whatever) and at my last meeting I requested to be able to wear my noise cancelling headphones. They said I could do it during independent work just not while the teacher is giving instructions. This I was fine with, but then they said I couldn\u2019t wear them during a test. For me, tests are still \u201cnoisy\u201d because even though talking isn\u2019t allowed, that just means that all the background noise is amplified. I can hear people clicking on their computers, tapping their feet, tapping their pencil, shifting around, etc. I told them this and they said that due to cheating, they couldn\u2019t make an exception. I told them that my headphones, while electronic, are not hooked up to my phone and I don\u2019t even use them to play music. I just use them to block out sound. They didn\u2019t care. They said that they could instead take me to a \u201cquiet room\u201d for testing, but I have numerous reasons why this wouldn\u2019t work for me. They still didn\u2019t care.

        "answer": "Firstly, congratulations. That's quite an achievement.\r\n\r\nLet's look at things another way. Say that you were to start smoking a little weed, here and there. Giving yourself the permission and taking on the personal responsibility of doing so. Aware of the risks as such, that you may branch out a little bit, here and there - and then maybe - have a few blowouts. That's entirely a reasonable possibility. Who knows really what the consequences of that might be.\r\n\r\nMore than that though, how would/might this impact your relationships? With your wife and children? What's the worst possible outcome that you might face here? What's the best possible outcome you could achieve? And looking at both of them; is the person you want to be?\r\n\r\nIt would be unusual for you not, from time to time, to have intrusive thoughts. If you're tired, from not enough sleep. Or maybe you're not interacting enough in meaningful relationships with people; your environment really plays a massive role here. Well, it can start to play a trick or two on you. You start to have doubts; \"Oh, just once - what harm can it really do?\" \r\n\r\nSometimes you just have to acknowledge that you're not feeling great about life or some aspects of it. And then just say; \"Okay, so I'm feeling / thinking these things. They're just thoughts. I don't need them, so I can let them go.\" And you really can. That's the power you have now; you can make a choice. Sometimes we don't realise how much influence in the outcomes of our lives, and that there is a space for us to make a choice. We can influence our impulses.\r\n\r\nI wish you well. I really do. You made a choice to come and get support. That's shows you have a level of depth and maturity. That you care. Things may still provoke or irritate you, but don't forget that you have come so far already. And you still have a way to go. Just how that turns out, lies at your feet.",

I\u2019ve always been a functioning addict but when I lost my live in gf of 5 years, a few weeks later my company sold and my management position was eliminated and I was partnerless and jobless in a big house that requires two earners to afford. My abuse went into over drive. I was using it to cope with what clearly was depression setting in. I played the tough guy and pretended I was doing fine and things were getting better. I moved closer to family and yet continued my self destruction. I\u2019m sure they\u2019ve noticed but I thought I hid it. After a few months I found a good job so I thought. I watched for other opportunities as upper management worked me to the ground. So I continued using on the same pace as I had begun after the breakup. Finally one day before Christmas I sat with my boss and said I can\u2019t keep working into the ground and watch my life balance completely disappear. I wasn\u2019t able to date to see friends and I saw my family less than when I lived in another state. Our separation was ammlicable.  But I continued to use. Haven\u2019t found a job and have done nothing but stew about what came and went in my life this year and how a habit is clearly to blame in a lot of this. I\u2019ve slept much of it off the last two days and I\u2019m not fuzzy mentally at the moment. But the emotional havoc my mind is having when I think to the past and all that I\u2019ve lost and all that\u2019s been removed from my life that I held so dearly because of my selfishness and my addiction just makes me sick. I know right now I need to focus on what my future can bring by being sober and never touching this dream killer again and later come to terms with the past but damn it\u2019s hard. I don\u2019t wanna touch the stuff or see the stuff ever again and I\u2019ll never forgive myself for what I let do to me. But how can I begin to to see what good will come for saying I\u2019m done no more I will not let this drug suck me in? There is a lyric from a song that I keep sticking to give me strength.  \u201cThe change begins with one step. However small the first step is hardest of all. But when I get my gait I\u2019ll be walking tall\u201d I know I can get my life back. Thank you for reading.",
        "answer": "Thanks for posting.  It\u2019s a difficult decision to stick to, but the good thing is, with meth the wd\u2019s aren\u2019t physical, you might get some stomach cramps and be excessively tired and hungry, I\u2019ve quit many times and the only positive thing I could tell myself some days was \u201cthank god I\u2019m not wd from heroin\u201d.  and also it helps to remember that there\u2019s no way in hell reintroducing meth into your life will improve your lifestyle.",

        "question": "My friends keep using their autism as an excuse for everything As the title says, no matter what happens they say \"it's because I'm autistic\" and expect to get away with it. They're both diagnosed, i show symptoms of it but so far undiagnosed (I've been trying for years though).\r\n\r\nOne (Friend 1) of them is always loud and talks over the teachers (we're in college), they act rude, and argue with our teachers and then say \"I'm autistic\" or \"I'm sorry, let me just stop being autistic\". The other one (Friend 2) called my tutor an ableist just because she asked my friends to turn their voices down and, of course, came the \"I'm autistic, I'm loud\".\r\n\r\nShe sometimes lumps me into it, i never blame my, potential, autism because that's what it currently is, potential.\r\n\r\nAnother friend recently brought this up with me, we were talking and something came up that i struggle with and he said \"let me guess, it's because you're autistic\" so i asked him not to say that i just struggle with things, he replied with \"i thought you would say that as Friend 1 always says it\"\r\n\r\nShould i ask Friend 1 to stop?

        "answer": "Not realising how loud I am is something I struggle with too but I also hate when people are too loud so the correct behaviour when someone points out to me that I\u2019m too loud is to be thankful they told me and lower my voice.

        "question": "Do you also feel like you're not human? I'm a lvl 2 autistic person (almost lvl 3), with adhd, high abilities, and savantism (and paranoid personality disorder, actually). One thing that I feel very strongly is how I'm totally different from neurotypicals, to the point that I totally feel like I'm not human. Its like I'm hidden among them, copying their behaviour to fit in (because I do like them), but that's not the case at all. Its so uncanny how I can relate to robots and androids on movies, due to their logic and way of learning. Neurotypicals seems very confusing and chaotic to me; most things they do and say don't make sense whatsoever. I do spend a lot of time consuming media to copy human neurotypical behaviour, like movies and books. I do perform way above average (have high IQ, took courses at Harvard, going medical school now) and I'm a very fast reader (hiperlexia) that can easily manage goals and some taks; but its just to totally fail in some activities and a mixed feeling of being around people that seems both less inteligent at most things, but seems to do magic things (like recognize people from their faces, drive, or understand social situations from a non-theoretical point of view).\r\n\r\nDo any of you also fell like that? I also have some very strong insights due to hiperfocus, so these are periods of intense, almost maniac creativity. Do you guys also have it?

        "question": "Is my relationship toxic or is it my ASD? I (34F) have been with my NT partner (35M) for 2 years. We\u2019re long distance and always have been. He knows about my ASD and everything was cute or quirky or something we would handle together until recently. I work a very intense job as a department head and have to be \u2018on\u2019 all day Monday through Saturday. It\u2019s exhausting for me. I talk to him on the phone as much as I can during the work day while he\u2019s driving and text when I can\u2019t talk. I felt like I was doing really well but lately we have blow ups where he says I\u2019m not communicating enough. Today was bad. He said I don\u2019t love him and don\u2019t want him and don\u2019t care about his needs because I try to take Sundays to decompress and we didn\u2019t talk on the phone for 3 days. \r\n\r\nI tried to work through it but he just kept texting me how bad I was making him feel. I lost it and just retreated so far in myself I couldn\u2019t climb out. \r\n\r\nI went to my therapist today and they asked me to reflect on the moments I felt most lost. \r\nI just don\u2019t know if this is my ASD and I think I\u2019m doing enough or if this relationship is toxic as ever and I\u2019m being gaslighted to oblivion.

        "question": "How to survive alone Hey, UK here. I was diagnosed with autism and ADHD a year ago (I am 26). I also have severe depression + dysthymia. I still live with my mum (62) and I\u2019m terrified for what will happen when she dies. My dad isn\u2019t in the picture and I have no other immediate family. She does everything for me and I have tried to be more independent but I can barely manage to brush my teeth most days. I know nothing about our finances, about the house, about tax, about anything, and even if I did, I wouldn\u2019t be able to cope with managing them. \r\n\r\nI feel like a fraud for saying this because I am considered \u2018low support needs\u2019 and have no learning disabilities (unless you count ADHD but my grades were fine). I can speak and socialise and I don\u2019t have epilepsy or seizures or anything like that. \r\n\r\nYet I just feel with some certainty that when my mum dies I will end up dead one way or another because I can\u2019t look after myself or do adult things. I doubt I\u2019d be able to get a carer because I\u2019m not \u2018autistic enough\u2019 and I\u2019m freaking out, I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m gonna do. This is not a post about handling grief - this is me genuinely thinking I will die without the support that my mother gives me and being terrified of that. Has anyone gone through something similar?",
        "answer": "Long post so TLDR: Your mum can help you prepare for this now, and there's lots of small steps that will help if you can take any of them. Try to get her to take on the task of accessing that support for you, so it's not all on her, and she can help to get you through it with her support.\r\n\r\nIf you haven't already, I think it might be good to have this conversation with your mum (or have it again) and try to get her to *use her time with you to help you safeguard your future*. If you can't present this as 'I don't know how I'm going to survive when you die', you could come at it as 'I want to access all the state and charity help available to me, so I'm not a burden as you're getting older, and you can enjoy you retirement'. Parents often default to just focusing on taking care of you, but some extra support would help you care for her too.\r\n\r\nIf you're not already on benefits, get her to help you get it sorted. Even if you don't need the income, it gives you national insurance contributions, which you'll need to have a pension. Universal credit isn't much, but there are sometimes upticks for sickness and disability that may apply. You can apply for PIP on top of that, which is a long process and requires some fighting, but can bring you around \u00a3300 a month. You can ask the local council for a social worker and an occupational therapist. They might help anyway, but more importantly, this will give you official allies other than your mum, and create a useful paper record of people who can authenticate that you can't function alone. One day you might need this to qualify for benefits or sheltered living. The local council can put you on a waitlist for supported living, too. It takes years, and you don't necessarily need to take anything they offer you (you can say it's not suitable if it's too far from your mum), but again, it keeps you in the system so when your mom's not around, you don't have to engage for the first time alone. \r\n\r\nCitizens Advice can help with all of this. You mum can make appointments for you and go with you to them to advocate for you. They'll tell you what to write on applications, and how to articulate your difficulties. Local charity branches like Scope and Mind might offer in person support, and Scope has online help too. It may be worth going to your GP, too, and asking if there's any support you haven't already tried. They often know local stuff you won't hear about otherwise. Again, your mum can come and basically do the appointment for you - and it can be on the phone if that's easier, you don't need to say anything except confirming your details and that you'd like her to speak for you. If you think it would be helpful, you can also request to be referred back into autism services for a reassessment that states in writing that you need support for daily living.\r\n\r\nAll these things might seem overwhelming and of little immediate value, but they're the kind of things that are much easier to handle with a parent to advocate than they are alone. Doing any of them will give you allies and evidence when you need it. You can line everything up now to make sure you'll be safer and secure longer term. \r\n\r\nI've been alone and nonfunctional without parental support after I came out, and I really wished I'd used the support available to me while I still had it. I accrued a lot of trauma that could've been avoided if I'd asked my parents to set me up for independence, back while I still had their support. The best gift your mum can give you, as a parent, is access to the support you need to be able to survive her. She must worry about this too, and helping each other think about it and prepare for it will be good for both of you in the long run. Every little bit helps. Best of luck to you.",

        "question": "What's a reasonable boundary to set re. my friend's cocaine use? I'm not an expert, but from what I can tell, my friend is a drug addict. Primarily he uses cocaine but he has experimented with harder substances. He has good times and bad times, where he uses more (like multiple times a week) and reacts worse.\r\n\r\nDuring the bad times he is incredibly difficult to deal with, and he can be very mean. After a very bad recent episode I threatened to end our friendship over his out-of-control drug use for my own mental health, and he told me he would get clean. AFAIK he was clean for a few months, then he took cocaine again. He told me that his therapist has agreed that it's fine to do cocaine occasionally, as long as he doesn't do anything harder.\r\n\r\nMy question is: how often is actually reasonable? I understand that some people can do it occasionally without developing a critical issue, but I don't feel super confident in my friend's ability to self-regulate. As such, I want to set a clear boundary about how much cocaine use I can tolerate from him, something along the lines of \"if you do cocaine more frequently than X amount of times per X unit of time measurement then I'll have to re-evaluate our friendship.\" Is once per month reasonable? I'd feel more comfortable with maybe once every two or three months, but is that too restrictive? Or am I going about this totally wrong? I want to set a boundary, yes, but I also want it to be a limit that he can reasonably adhere to.\r\n\r\nSorry for the essay. Grateful for any advice.",
        "answer": "Giving anyone an ultimatum, even though you are well meaning and only doing so out of love, will only backfire on you. I don\u2019t have a good answer for you, I\u2019m not sure there is one. Actually, any time his drug abuse affects you is unacceptable and it\u2019s okay to let them know that.

Okay backstory is my husband (been together nearly 7 years) is 26, was heavily addicted to pills from a very young age about 19, so maybe age 13/14 til 19. \r\nHe has a a few relapses that I caught since then, but to my knowledge nothing really in at least 3-4 years. He just uses thc pens regularly now. \r\n\r\nToday I got all 4 of my wisdom teeth removed and was prescribed 8 hydrocodone with i think acetaminophen.

IRD incredibly painful to watch the ones we love do things that hurt us and themselves. \r\n\r\nA few thoughts I have\u2026 \r\n\r\n1. An addict has an addiction that stays with them forever regardless of if they get professional help or not. Professional help (therapist, 12 steps, SMART recovery, treatment program, sponsor, support network, etc) is to develop tools and new coping mechanisms with an aim to increase the likelihood of staying sober. The addiction will always be in the background, that\u2019s why guys with 20 years sober still say they got there \u201cone day at a time\u201d. \r\n\r\n2. Don\u2019t ask him, because he might deny it and that will make you crazy. Always trust your gut. Tell him you know and do not need to argue or prove you know. Do not give in or give room to negotiate what you know happened. Walk away if you have to and go silent and wait. \r\n\r\n3. Set boundaries, and make sure you are prepared to follow through. Anger or hurt feelings without boundaries does not inspire changed behavior. Boundaries without follow through erase your credibility. Consider things like \u201cI will not be in a relationship with an addict who is not pursuing recovery and following all treatment recommendations\u201d. Or \u201cgoing forward all narcotic medication will be going on a safe only I have the combination to\u201d.\r\n\r\n4.

I should've walked away at the first chance and faked a mental breakdown or something. Now, I don't know what to do.\r\n\r\nPlans on meeting in person shattered after I decided that I've waited too long and told him I have a crush on him, and it turns out, I'm his type as well.\r\n\r\nI wasn't disappointed in him, but I was proud of him for declining any possibility of a meet up and told him that. But because of it, I've fallen harder, while at the same time I have also been putting a lot of overtime to only ever see him as a dear friend.\r\n\r\nI don't know if I should walk away if I'm being honest and just disappear without a word. I don't want to be a homewrecker. I don't want to hurt him. I don't want to make him regret ever meeting me.\r\n\r\nI have so many limited options. I want to be his friend and be there for him, but I'm worried it'll escalate to emotional cheating if it already hasn't. \r\n\r\nHe's not supposed to be mine to lose, and yet here I am. \r\n\r\nWhat should I do? \r\n\r\nI don't know anymore if I made the right choice and if I should've just kept him wondering about how I truly see him, and how I wouldn't mind being with him.\r\n\r\nHe's been with another woman, long distance for a few years now.

For background context, I'm lds and I hate it, plan on becoming inactive when I turn 18. We had to do a youth activity and it was everyone combined, and we had to do minute to win it games. My group sucked, I was with kids who were very loud and obnoxious, and once the games started everyone was just screaming and yelling, and it was very ovsrstimulating to me. Luckily I was able to text my dad and ask if I could go home early and he said yes (he's also autistic and has worked with people with autism before). I feel a little better now that I'm away from all the noise and such, but I still feel like I'm on the verge of breaking down crying.

        "answer": "Breathe in for 5 seconds, hold your breath for 2 seconds, and breathe out for 7 seconds. Repeat until you feel calmer. It\u2019ll help slow your heart rate down and activate your sympathetic nervous system. This will help calm you down physically.\r\n\r\nFor a \u201csensory reset,\u201d find a room you feel comfortable in, maybe your bedroom. Lower the light level to a comfortable level, or turn them off completely. For sound, either listen to something you like, or nothing at all if it\u2019s already quiet. Wear clothing you feel most comfortable in. This will help bring you back to base level, sensory-wise.\r\n\r\nIf you have a lot of thoughts in your head, talk to someone you trust. Maybe your dad, since it seems like he\u2019d understand. If talking is too much at the moment, try writing them down instead. This will help you process your thoughts and emotions and help get them out of your system.\r\n\r\nA hot drink and a good safe meal/snack will help rebuild your energy.\r\n\r\nThis is stuff that I find helpful.

It\u2019s a thin line.\r\n\r\nHe watches nursery rhymes on TV while we both work from home. Our daughter isn\u2019t in the room with us. It\u2019s just the two of us.\r\n\r\nHe isn\u2019t actually interested in the nursery rhymes but my mum or MIL puts them on for our daughter when she is babysitting. Its those super simple songs nursery rhyme songs. It\u2019s background noise. It\u2019s driving me insane. He\u2019s gotten used to the noise and visuals when my mum or MIL is watching our daughter while he\u2019s working from home.\r\n\r\nI\u2019m working from home at the moment as well. I occasionally sit on the sofa while working which is opposite the tv.\r\n\r\nHe sits at the dinner table essentially facing the tv sideways as well. For him it\u2019s some visual/auditory stim. I want to respect his comfort but at the same time I want him to respect mine if I do decide to sit in the living room. Even with the noise cancelling headphones the visuals are bothering me. He got very defensive when I tried turning it off and asked me why I\u2019m even sitting here.\r\n\r\nWhat can I do to be more understanding?",
        "answer": "My take as an autistic person is that your sensory needs are not inherently less important than your husband's sensory needs, even if you happen to be neurotypical or don't have any diagnosis. \r\n\r\nYou are being sufficiently understanding of your husband's sensory needs. I think that the problem is that only your husband's sensory needs are being accommodated in the household, when your sensory needs are valid as well. Everyone has sensory needs, including neurotypicals. \r\n\r\nIf the noise and visuals make you feel like you are being driven insane, then that's a serious problem, and your husband should care about your wellbeing in addition to his own. Having autism doesn't make you exempt from caring about your spouse or mean that no one else's needs have to be taken into consideration. I don't think that you should have to suffer just because he likes rituals. \r\n\r\nI think he needs to work out some sort of compromise if you feel like you are being driven insane by the noise. This sounds like a case of [conflicting access needs (article from Thinking Person's Guide to Autism)](https://thinkingautismguide.com/2018/10/acknowledging-and-accepting-competing-accessibility.html).\r\n\r\nHave you tried telling him how much the noise stresses you out?\r\n\r\nDo you think he might have OCD in addition to autism?\r\n\r\nWhatever is going on, he absolutely needs to be willing to listen to you and take your discomfort seriously.\r\n\r\nAnother thing: I don't know your gender, so I don't know if this is relevant to your particular situation, but a lot of women are taught that they are supposed to put their husbands' needs before their own and sacrifice their personal wellbeing for their husbands' comfort or convenience. Some people who aren't women also struggle with the subconscious belief that only their partner's needs are important.",

My school doesn't know I'm autistic (I was diagnosed a few months ago and I'm an adult, so I didn't feel the need to tell them).\r\n\r\nI can handle noise by wearing earplugs when it gets overwhelming, so I've got that covered. The teachers probably don't even notice when I'm wearing them. \r\n\r\nMy main issue is LIGHTS. The lights bother me so much. There are a few classrooms where the lights are super bright and they make me feel like my head is about to explode. There are days when I can go into the classroom and the lights don't bother me at all, but there are also days when I just can't handle it. \r\n\r\nI have no idea how to solve this because sometimes when I ask the teacher to turn off some of the lights they refuse, because they need them for visibility. Other times they oblige and I feel much better. \r\n\r\nIt also makes me feel so guilty because there's another 30 people in the classroom with me and they probably prefer to have all the lights on. \r\n\r\nI had a terrible day today because during two of the lessons the lights bothered me too much. I was so upset the whole day and I didn't know what to do. I just suffered in silence and stimmed excessively. \r\n\r\nI really don't know how to solve this because it's such a niche problem.

        "question": "My Roommate Has Communicated With Me That He is Suicidal and it\u2019s Somewhat my Fault I started college in August of 2022. Since then, my roommate, that I was assigned randomly, has told me things about him being jealous of me for having friends, because he claims to have none, and that he constantly thinks about killing himself. \r\n\r\nI barely know him. We rarely talk, and he started telling me these things very early on. \r\n\r\nI have called the emergency hotline him and I even made direct contact with his mom about my concern about him. \r\n\r\nBut the thing is, I talk about it to my friends, and think it\u2019s a huge burden for me to carry, and that I shouldn\u2019t be the one responsible for getting him all this help and support. \r\n\r\nTonight, my friends said that it is none of my business to tell other people that he\u2019s suicidal, and they think it\u2019s rude for me to tell them his business. I say that I\u2019m near a stranger to him, and that it shouldn\u2019t be my responsibility to save his life, and they say that I\u2019m no stranger, I\u2019m his roommate. Meanwhile, I was just randomly selected by the university to live with him for a school year. Just because I\u2019m his roommate doesn\u2019t mean I necessarily know him or have a bond with him. \r\n\r\nSometimes I bring friends over to our dorm to stop by, and he tells them, people he\u2019s never met before, that he\u2019s suicidal and things along those lines. Those people are complete strangers to him, and I don\u2019t think they should have to bare responsibility for him either. I think it\u2019s something highly inappropriate to be telling us, because we are no therapists or other mental health professional.\r\n\r\nI think we are justified in telling other people because this is a huge thing to be telling a practical stranger, and we need to release our stresses in life, but my friends were saying he\u2019s coming to me because \u201che feels security with me and trusts me\u201d. But I feel this isn\u2019t the case because I barely know him, and he tells my friends that\u2019s just shortly stop by at our dorm. I shouldn\u2019t be the person to determine whether he live or die. \r\n\r\nMy friends tell me that my perspective is likely distorted because of my sister, whom is bipolar and severely mentally ill and suicidal. I say that doesn\u2019t have much to do with it, he should not be telling me and my friends about this stuff, and if he does, we are free to feel uncomfortable with it. \r\n\r\nThe thing that annoys me the most is that they don\u2019t live with him, so they don\u2019t understand the situation.

Let\u2019s just say that \u201ccuriosity\u201d turned into something more. I couldn\u2019t get enough of this stuff. A \u201cSaturday night only\u201d thing turned into a weekend thing. Then, It turned into me smoking on school nights. From there, it\u2019s just gotten out of hand. Since 15, I\u2019ve taken 3 T breaks. That\u2019s it. With all this being said, I\u2019ve gotten myself stuck. Weed has ruined me. I used to be this fun, energetic kid filled with life and happiness. (It\u2019s kinda funny, I would always say to myself before all of this  \u201cwhy do people get sad? Just be happy\u201d). I found myself stoner friends that just encourage my weed addiction and vaping. I barely have any motivation anymore and the \u201canxiety of life,\u201d as they call it, is really getting to me. I\u2019m not happy with the person I\u2019ve become. Im scared for who I might become. I feel sluggish, brain dead, and unmotivated all the time. Weed has become me. And I feel if I keep staying on this road, it\u2019ll end me. Does anyone have any suggestions for quitting?",
        "answer": "That's tough, but the good news is that you're aware of it and looking for help. One suggestion I've heard from people who've successfully quit or reduced their weed use is finding alternative ways to manage stress and anxiety, whether that's through exercise, therapy, meditation, or anything else that works for you.\r  \r\n\r  \r\nAnother thing to consider is reaching out to a support group, like a 12-step program specifically for people trying to quit or reduce their weed consumption. They can provide a community of other people who are going through the same thing and offer accountability and support as you navigate this process.\r  \r\n\r  \r\nFinally, it might be worth trying some CBD products like [https://blondebud.com/product/cbd-cbg-tincture/](https://blondebud.com/product/cbd-cbg-tincture/) as a way to manage symptoms of anxiety or stress without the negative side effects of THC.

Before that, he was doing coke and ketamine quite often. Daily at some point. Eventually he opened up and told me he was struggling with addiction. It made me sad and I wanted to help. Fast forward to once we actually started dating. He claims he has been sober the entire time aside from two slip ups. One in august. One last weekend. I do not believe this at all and what makes it worse is that he becomes extremely defensive and angry when I tell him that. The reason I don\u2019t believe it is that for the entirety of our relationship, he is ALWAYS broke. No matter how much he works. For some background, I\u2019m the bread winner in our relationship and I pay all of the bills. He doesn\u2019t have to pay a thing. So for him to always be broke is very suspicious. His money basically disappears. Also, there are so many times where he\u2019ll be up all hours of the night into the early morning with the sniffles and ends up falling asleep with tissue in his nose. This is what led me to finding out he was doing coke last week. I looked around the room and within a minute of searching, found a coke straw in his empty cigarette box. Anyway, I do not believe that this was only one of two times he has slipped up since we got together. I\u2019ve just never really tried to bring it up even if I noticed signs. But I\u2019m getting upset about being lied to and I just want him to feel comfortable enough to be honest. What can I do?",
        "answer": "There is so much shame around addiction, it's difficult for him to be honest.  He's probably struggling with that. The only thing that would help him is unconditional love, that he feels secure that he won't be rejected for having this addiction. As long as he hides, he won't take responsability for his addiction. I say that as an addict in recovery that used to hide from my wife.   \r\nIf he can go beyond the shame, he may be able to look for help, therapy or support group, that's the only way out. You can show him the way by joining yourself an al-anon support groups, it's hard to deal on your own with an addicted partner. Have a look at /r/naranon/ too.",

        "question": "I (17, female) suspect that I might be autistic but my father doesn\u2019t believe me. What should I do? So for context, I have a complicated relationship with my father. He doesn\u2019t really know me that well and I didn\u2019t plan on opening up to him about me. He also studied psychology in the eighties (he\u2019s not a psychologist/psychiatrist though) which makes this problem more complicated than it already is.\r\n\r\nThis happened yesterday evening. I was talking to him about how stressful life is and somehow I thought it was a good idea to let him know that the therapist I went to for a short period of time thought I might be autistic and how I think it might be true. I don\u2019t know, I just felt trusting in that moment. I think I should\u2019ve kept my mouth shut.\r\n\r\nSo basically, he doesn\u2019t think I can be autistic for a number of reasons:\r\n\r\nFor starters, he doesn\u2019t like labels. He thinks that focusing on a label is bad. He also accused me of thinking that \"I think I know better than real professionals\u201c whether I\u2019m autistic or not just because I explained that I want to be taken seriously by doctors and that I would be disappointed if they just dismissed me because I have good grades and can live a \"normal\u201c life. He said that I focus on labeling myself too much and that therapy is more important than getting a diagnosis. I know that, and to be honest I don\u2019t get why he assumes that I only want the diagnosis and not get therapy after.\r\n\r\nThen, when I explained that I relate to all of the symptoms of autism he told me that that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean I am autistic. I get that, but how does that matter? Self diagnosis is the first step to getting a real diagnosis. I told him that I did all the self assessments on \"Embrace Autism\u201c and did a ton of research but he doesn\u2019t buy it. He seems to think that I am biased and chose my answers so that the test answers would say I\u2019m autistic. Furthermore, when I listed a few autistic traits that I exhibit he just said: \"That\u2019s normal, you inherited that from my family. I also do all of these things.\u201c He also blatantly ignored some of the other traits I mentioned, like not understanding sarcasm. We talked about my childhood briefly and I mentioned that I had a lot of special interests and unusual fixations, like my obsession with dinosaurs when I was five: I learned all of the Latin names, collected dinosaur figures, read all of the books, watched all of the documentaries etc. He simply told me that that was perfectly normal because \"he did that too as a child\u201c. \r\n\r\n\r\nAdditionally, he says that he met some autistic people during his time as a psychology student and that they were all severely autistic and \"not like me at all\u201c and that most autistic people have a lower than average iq- since I am a \"smart kid\u201c I can\u2019t be autistic apparently.\r\n\r\nI just want to be taken seriously for once. I know that I\u2019m not better than professionals and that I can\u2019t just \"decide\" that I\u2019m autistic. But I never once claimed to be autistic anyways, I literally just said \"After a great amount of research and self assessments and self reflection I think I might be autistic\u201c. I don\u2019t see the harm in that.\r\n\r\nMy father offered me to take a look at the list of my symptoms that I made.

Here are some stuff you can prepare in anticipation of a referral:\r\n\r\n\u2022 since it doesn\u2019t sounds like your dad will be of much help, find a relative (mum, grandparents, aunt, uncle) that you saw often when you were a kid. Cus autism assessements require that someone that watched you grow up tell the people evaluating you what you were like as a child. \r\n\r\n\u2022 get a hold of all your childhood medical records, if you have it, something that also records your developmental milestones. This is good to have as a whole when you\u2019re an adult, but especially important for an autism Assessement. It\u2019ll help the psychiatrist determine if you are autistic with or without a learning disability (what they used to call autistic or Asperger\u2019s)\r\n\r\n\u2022 don\u2019t listen to your dad and to his bs, if you feel you need to be evaluated, you will do it.

        "question": "Pros and cons of seeking a diagnosis as an adult Hi r/autism!\r\n\r\nI'm an elder with kids and grand-kids. Legally, I have reached the age where I have the right to be a retiree in my country, but I have told my employer that I will continue working (I'm a programmer) as long as I'm legally allowed, since programming is my number 1, 2, 3 (and so on) hobby in life.\r\n\r\nI've never really felt different than others in my entire life. Maybe I have felt from time to time that other people aren't really normal and have odd perception of things, super-human listening comprehension or very strange social norms.\r\n\r\nLast week, one of my grandchildren was diagnosed with (mild) Autism spectrum disorder.  I was extremely surprised and baffled. In my eyes, he was just normal. He was **just like me**. I've kept telling his parents for many years that they didn't need to worry one bit about autism, because obviously he was totally normal. In my eyes, it is perfectly normal to get angry beyond control when small things changes in life, or when someone interrupt you in what you are doing. Running away, hiding, closing yourself off and refusing to speak or interact with the world is the default human behavior when upset.\r\n\r\nI was **very surprised** to learn he *do in fact* have autism, to put it mildly. So this weekend I read on the medical information portal of my country about autism. And instead of recognizing **my grandson**, I recognized **myself**.\r\n\r\nThey listed about 25\\~ish common symptoms you may experience when you fall into the autism spectrum. I had a **strong** (or **extremely strong** in many cases) feeling of recognition of about 21 of the symptoms. I don't think I need to tell all my symptoms, as you can't diagnose me anyway. \r\n\r\nOver the weekend, I've talked with my wife, kids and my surviving siblings about this. No-one says they are surprised. Everyone has quietly assumed there was *something* different about me, but haven't really cared what. My wife confessed that she had a soul-to-soul conversation with my mother at my wedding, where my mother said that she had always suspected that I had Asperger syndrome or (mild) Autism, but that no-one else seemed to think that. She even sent me to a child psychiatrist when I was 7, but he shrugged it off and concluded I was normal as normal can be. Though, in hindsight, he didn't even speak my language, as I had just moved to a new country, so I have severe doubts about that conclusion... *(my parents where exiles and had a consultancy firm where they took 6 or 12 month assignments all over the world, so we moved to a new country once or twice per year)*\r\n\r\nNow that I think of it. It just all makes sense. But my question is, what are the pros and cons of seeking a diagnosis at my age? Is it even possible? \r\n\r\nI feel like I would want to know for sure. But at the same time, I'm afraid of what it means to me to learn that I'm \u2014 in fact \u2014 *not normal.* What would you advice me to do?",

Recently, they got pulled up for 2 emails that were considered 'rude' by their manager (and 1 of them by manager who forwarded it to their manager. They're being put on a performance improvement plan, despite the emails sounding factual and straightforward by my friend. \r\n\r\nThen last week, I had a discussion with my manager over a sentence I put in an email that he didn't like because I shouldn't be 'telling a manager what to do with their staff'. Their member of staff messed up big time, I had to clean up the mess, and came in the find something else wasn't done, so I explained and asked them 'please can you also discuss this with X person'.\r\n\r\nMy boss has said it's not rude or inappropriate, but that if I were to write something similar again it would be an issue. Apparently he would be annoyed to receive an email with something like that in it.\r\n\r\nI don't think it's rude, and I feel like it's being direct and clear. I expect others to be direct and clear with me, though they often aren't.\r\n\r\nI think if a manager is offended by a polite suggestion they are insecure.

I can't change who I am or how I think, and in this case the feedback doesn't make sense to me as something that needs to be changed.\r\n\r\nETA: I didn't realise I left the point hanging about my friend. The reason I included that was because it's making me feel that we're both misunderstood and this has only happened over the course of a few weeks and we've both been working there for at least a few years. So the discussion with my manager was even more upsetting to me and I'm not feeling that our workplace is particularly ND friendly.",
        "answer": "First.  Off. Not defending the boss here so dont come at me. \ud83d\ude07. Most bosses dont get boss training and deep down are a bit insecure. You are 100% right about that.They get triggered by anything that feels like insubordination.  Insubordination is a subjective term that just means that you didnt 100% defer to them.  They can call you insubordinate because of any reason they pick. A direct request is perceived to be an order which feels threatening to their ego.  So you gotta pussyfoot around these issues.  I Suggest. \u201cI just wanted to let yiu know I had this situation where blah blah happened/keeps happening and i could not finish the task you assigned me to do because this thing took up my time.  You werent here for me to ask so . Can you please LMK what I should do if thus happens again? \u201cSo. Your phrasing it as a polite question to them. That gives the boss the chance to DECIDE what do do.  Bosses love DECIDING. IT MAKES THEM FEEM LESS INSECURE.    And giving the boss a chance at advising YOU instead if you advising them.

        "question": "Therapist minimizes my experiences Hello everyone! So, I've been writing my therapist papers about my experience during childhood, (she says it's amazing and that it helps us discuss it). But we recently got into the page about how I stood out as a kid.\r\n\r\nIn the page I called myself \"the weird kid\" and my therapist immediately went \" Well, I don't think it's okay for you to say that about yourself\". I tried to explain how I see no problem with it since I was quite literally weird/odd.\r\n\r\nShe started telling how she doesn't even believe there is such a thing as \"normality\" and asked me to define \"normal\". \r\n\r\nI felt like my whole experience was just minimized, misunderstood, and mocked. I felt embarassed and wanted to cry as she kept telling me I'm \"just like everyone else\".\r\n\r\nHow can I explain to her that I, as an autistic person, am not \"normal\" by society's definition?\r\nHas anyone else experienced this, and if so, how did you deal with it?\r\n\r\n(For context I'm 16 and live in finland, and my therapist said she \"isn't specialised in autism/knows very little about autism\", and that her \"field is more in adhd\". My therapist is also neurotypical)",
        "answer": "God damn I typed a whole ass comment about my experience, went to google translate to search for 1 English word and the whole paragraph is gone. I am pissed. \r\n\r\n\r\nIt was something along the lines of:\r\n\r\nI am 20 years old and had troubles with myself and everything around me for about my whole damn life. Only a few months ago I realized I could be autistic. I educated myself extremely much on the topic \"autism\" and discovered that everything just makes so much sense now that I know what the concept of autism actually is. \r\n\r\nI took the first step to tell my mother about it and she was a bit skeptical, but also uneducated, so we talked about it and she started to understand it way more. I got full support and understanding from her after she got to learn more about autism. We took the 2nd step together to talk to my doctor, in the hope she would give me an appointment with a good psychiatrist. \r\n\r\nI wrote 6 pages about my childhood and teenage years, traits I had, school problems and bullying I recieved etc etc... \r\n\r\nAnd she was like \"your mom spoiled you too much, that's all, anyways here's a therapist you can go to, to \"cure\" your stress.\" \r\n\r\nShe also said \"define normal to me. Nobody is normal. Everyone has a few weird traits. Even my own husband says I am a bit weird. Bla bla bla\"\r\n\r\nThe therapist I got sent to charged \u20ac65 for a \"get to know each other\"- appointment which is suoer expensive. At the end of the session she said she doesn't know anything about autism and that I should go to therapy weekly for \"curing\" my stress issues. \u20ac65 is a lot for an unemployed person with medical issues (insulin resistance and gynecological problems with surgery ahead). \r\n\r\nMy mom was angry when we went to the doctor's office, demanding an appointment with a psychiatrist. The doctor was irritated and didn't like this, but against her will she gave me an appointment. I went, and he was a kind man. He told me that in a couple of months that a testing center for autism will contact contact me and I will have to go through psychological tests for 2 days straight. So yay. \r\n\r\nBut my doctor was a bitch for not helping me and showing resistance. She didn't want to \"label me\" as an autist. But she did want to \"label me\" as a spoiled brat, not because I have an attitude (because I am quiet and shy af) or because I am rude or whatever (cuz I'm simply not), but because I have orientation issues and my mom always drove me to school because I didn't know the way to anywhere. \r\n\r\nGod bless my mom for that. And f*ck my doctor for that.",

I used to have meltdowns over not being able to sleep because I felt so much guilt and pressure and it is cyclical. The worse I felt the more anxious I got and the harder it was to sleep. Adding in that I knew it made my parents mad only added to the pressure (they saw it as some intentional refusal to cooperate).I get at her age sleep is important but the more worked up she gets the less likely it is to happen. Using things to distract her will make it even worse because they are likely stimulating her even more by pushing \"cures\" on her.\r\n\r\nWhat helped me was I had a therapist break it down for me like this:\r\nHim: what happens if you don't sleep? \r\n\r\nMe: I'll be tired\r\n\r\nHim: Right but what happens aside from that?\r\n\r\nMe: I'll be grumpy\r\n\r\nHim: So? What else?\r\n\r\nMe: huh?\r\n\r\nHim: Will the world end if you don't sleep?\r\n\r\nMe: no\r\n\r\nHim: so you'll be tired and grumpy? But the world keeps going?\r\n\r\nMe: yeah\r\n\r\nHim: okay so if you're tired and grumpy what happens?\r\n\r\nMe: I'll be tired and grumpy\r\n\r\nHim: but you're already grumpy from trying to sleep anyway and isn't tired the goal?\r\n\r\nThat's when a light went off. It doesn't matter if I dont sleep. I will eventually. Sleep isn't one of those things where if you miss out you never get the opportunity again.\r\n\r\nWhat I'd do with her at this stage is on a Friday night (or any non-school night) tell her she doesn't have to sleep - remove that sense of doom. But make it clear at a specific time that it is quiet time (tell her way in advance - let her know the expectation) \"you don't have to sleep but at X o'clock you will need to pick a quiet activity\" (colouring/a puzzle - heck even if she zones out on cartoons as long as she's being quiet let her do it). Reinforce there is no pressure for her to sleep. She just can't wake any household members up. I get this will suck for whoever has to stay up with her but I'm sure having her meltdown already does suck. See how it goes and how she does the next day and if it works maybe make it a reward for her during the week.\r\n\r\nEdited for formatting",

        "answer": " A little known tidbit of information, just because someone's brain works differently doesn't mean they can't be an asshole or wildly inappropriate. People are not angels because they have autism or ADHD. It is not a free-pass to be disrespectful or disregard other people's needs and desires, it's simply an explanation as to why they might not understand what they're doing. \r\n\r\nThe odds of someone's special interest being pornographic material of the specific race you are? I wouldn't buy that even if it were true. Sounds like a hormonal teenager to me who hasn't learned most people don't like leading a conversation with talking about porn. \r\n\r\nWe must all be careful with the term ableist because it can be abused in both directions. You are not ableist for being made uncomfortable by something that should make you uncomfortable. The fear of being marked ableist should never outweigh having your own boundaries with what you are comfortable with. Someone with autism is still capable of committing sexual assault.\r\n\r\nThe irony of autism is how many of us get frustrated at the idea of being forced to live in a world we can't conform to while also literally lacking the empathy that would enable us to understand why our own actions or behaviors may be frustrating to others.",

Going in the shower once a day. Just little things mainly around self-care. \r\n\r\nHe often flat out refuses to the point of threatening a meltdown - \u201cyou\u2019re making me ANGRY!!!!\u201d. His meltdowns are ferocious, and we have a 3 year old (his sister) to look out for too. \r\n\r\nAbout 50% of the time he does these requests no problem.

We don\u2019t ask him to do a lot, and all the things we ask are around self-care for his benefit. \r\n\r\nThank you all!!!",
        "answer": "I can't give many specific suggestions but maybe talking about possible reasons for why he behaves as he does that might be helpful to you for finding solutions:  \r\nIt's very likely that at least some of these self care tasks are things that he finds overwhelming. Possibly due to sensory overload (ie. the feeling of streams of hot water hitting his skin then running down it, the feeling of the soap on his body). The inconsistency could very well be due to how much energy he has/how overwhelmed he's currently feeling and, if so, it's likely that he's already closer to a meltdown when he's refusing than when he does them. Finding ways to make these tasks less overwhelming may help. Allowing him more leeway in when he does them so he can do them when he's less stressed may also help.  \r\nHis age is a big factor. A 9pm bedtime is not something I would expect most 13 year olds, autistic or not, to handle well. Most teenagers naturally sleep and wake up substantially later than children and most adults and you should probably consider extending it later.  \r\n\r\n\r\nAdditionally all the hormone shifts, social pressure, etc of being a boy that age going to cause big variations in mood and greatly increase the stress on him (which is even worse when you're autistic).  \r\n\r\n\r\nIt's not going to be easy. 13-14 were the worst years for both my personal experience and my behavior.",

I don't understand what it means anymore, or what people mean when they write it. Are you sarcastic? Scolding me? Or was what I said actually funny?

        "question": "What are signs of flirting from someone with autism? Sorry for how long this is, but I want to provide as much context as possible.\r\n\r\nIm allistic and have been trying to flirt with this one guy who has previously mentioned he is on the spectrum. I know that social cues between us are gonna be slightly off and that one\u2019s version of flirting can be the other\u2019s version of disinterest and Vice versa. \r\n\r\nHe\u2019s very kept to himself and task driven- goes to class, does work, gets food, then goes back to his dorm, so I can\u2019t really compare him interacting with others outside of seeing him at class. Granted, I have gotten him to come out with me to parties or movie night with friends a couple of times. Even if it\u2019s not his style, he will come for 30 mins or even come just to be around us even if he isn\u2019t actively participating in the conversation, which I am very appreciative of him merely being there. I have been trying to figure out his special interests just so I get to hear him ramble, but other than that, I don't really know what else to do in term of flirting.\r\n\r\nThere have been a couple moments where I thought he could be flirting but realized it could also be just him being nice. A key example i always bring up is (context: we met through a mutual friend), when we found out we shared a lecture and he sat at the direct front while I sat at the 4th row. He always comes in with headphones so when I saw him I texted him to turn around. When he did I only waved and said hi, nothing else. He then proceded to pick up all his stuff and move it next to me and has stayed sitting next to me in class since, without me ever asking him to. He explained the first time I met him that he liked sitting up front to hear the professor, so it shocked me he would sacrifice that to sit next to me. \r\n\r\nAnother instance is that we also found out we walk the same direction after class, he goes to work in the building before my next lecture\u2019s. However, he always takes what I consider is the longer way to his work: the 1) entry that\u2019s across my building, but goes up a flight of stairs then down a flight of stairs vs the 2) entry we pass first which is on the exact floor (no stairs) but cuts our time together by a minute.\r\n\r\nMaybe I\u2019m reading to much into things, but that\u2019s why I\u2019m on here .\r\nI guess I just want yalls opinion on \r\n1) what you think of the situation \r\n2) what are signs of flirting from someone on the spectrum \r\n3) if I were to ask him out or try to flirt back, how should I go about it\r\n\r\nThank you <3\r\n\r\nEdit: idk if this matters, but both of us have never dated before. That's at least why I am kinda lost with it all. I have no experience with either NDs or NTs\r\n\r\nSmall update: while I am still figuring out exactly the right time to tell him straight up that I like him, I am being a little more forward with him now. Asked him out for lunch (not as a date, just going to the dining hall) and telling him his side profile is pretty. He did go out of his way to go to the dining hall I recommended even though he first showed disdain for it due to the distance, so that was really sweet. Let\u2019s see how this goes!\r\n\r\nLast update: [link](https://www.reddit.com/r/autism/comments/10za5dz/update_we_are_just_friends/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)\r\nTLDR: we are just friends, but that\u2019s ok :)",
        "answer": "An Autistic\u2019s flirting would be a lot less subtle than an NT\u2019s flirting. It\u2019s best that you just tell him straight out that you\u2019re interested in him romantically since there\u2019s a good chance he doesn\u2019t even know you\u2019re flirting.",

I tried to confront my psychiatrist and ask him why he specifically diagnosed me with bipolar disorder and he didn\u2019t really have any specific reasons to support his decision. He kind of brushed me off and left it at that. I\u2019ve also tried to speak about this with my therapist (who by the way is appointed by the psychiatrist) and she also doesn\u2019t really care to entertain any of my concerns. \r\n\r\nI\u2019d like to possibly pursue this a little further by asking my GP for an assessment but I wanted to get a general advice/thoughts from this community before I take anymore steps. \r\n\r\nSymptoms that might indicate ASD:\r\n\r\n* I tend to get overwhelmed socially, usually leading to burn out, and feel like I can\u2019t exist at the same pace as everyone else around me. This is then followed by me spiraling into a depression. \r\n\r\n* I hyper-fixate on specific things (ex: I\u2019ve had a long standing obsession with books. I\u2019m constantly reading and when I\u2019m not reading I\u2019m watching videos about people who talk about books. And then if I\u2019m not doing that, I\u2019m buying/collecting them.) \r\n\r\n* I try to practice speaking in specific tones before socializing and tend to go over hypothetical conversations in my head.\r\n\r\n* although I\u2019ve recently learned to make acquaintances and friends, I can never sustain them because I tend to choose to stay home because the idea of socializing, following social cues, and trying to figure out whatever someone else is thinking to be utterly exhausting. (Most of my friendships are either family or long standing friends who aren\u2019t offended by not having seen me in months or possibly longer than that.) (I have about a handful or less of friends.) \r\n\r\n* I feel like the only reason that I come across as \u201csociable\u201d is because I mirror the energy and idiosyncrasies of the person that I\u2019m speaking to and then feel exhausted afterwords \r\n\r\n* I struggle to make eye contact (to the point where I\u2019ve been separated by teachers and called out on it from a pretty young age.) \r\n\r\n* My uncle and cousin are on the spectrum.\r\n\r\n* I tend to take jokes literally and don\u2019t find things that most people find funny to be funny. \r\n\r\n* I\u2019m 27 and struggle to work at fast paced/social jobs and have had to quit. (I worked at Starbucks for about a week before I got so overwhelmed that I out burned-out and then proceeded to spiral into a state of depression.) Right now I\u2019m only able to participate in school part time and work part time (and that\u2019s pushing it.) \r\n\r\nI realize that these can overlap with several other personality/anxiety disorders but I just wanted to get a sense of thoughts and advice before I begin the battle of trying to communicate this towards a doctor. \r\n\r\nThanks so much for your advice and kindness \u2764\ufe0f\u200d\ud83e\ude79",

        "question": "My son is being ignored at school Hello, I've been following this subreddit for a while now after my son was diagnosed in 1st grade and I've also had an inkling that I may also be autistic. My son (8m) has always been a happy kid. Always enthusiastic about school and learning, especially playing with his friends. He's in 2nd grade now and here's where I'm seeking advice. Some days he'll come home from school and will say some kid said something mean to him. Usually when that happens I'll tell him,  \"Maybe they were having a bad day. Just give them some space and when they're ready to be friendly, they'll come and find you. You aren't what they say, you know you're smart and nice, don't let anyone's mean words ruin your day\". Usually that helps him.  Lately, he's not been wanting to get up and he's not his silly self as much. As a mom, it hurts a lot. He came home about a week ago and said a lot of kids were saying mean things to him.  I went straight to the teacher and asked if she knew anything and told her about the situation. She said my son never told her anything about it but she'll talk to the kids. My son came home and said she talked to them all and it put an end to it but now they're ignoring him.  This morning, I saw him walk to his classroom line and said hello and all the kids just left or turned away. He walked to the back of the line where he stayed alone until the teacher came to get her class. My son is sweet but I understand he can ask a million questions (which we work on) and he sets his boundaries pretty early on with anyone (importantly he doesn't like anyone getting into his personal space), he loves to talk about his special interests a lot, and he doesn't pick up on jokes and he gets frustrated at them (we try to help him with that as well). He doesn't pick up on social cues sometimes so it leads to him playing along when they mess with him or they sometimes take his stuff. He claims they're borrowing it but most of the time he never gets his supplies back. He'll say, \"They forgot it but it's OK mommy\", and eventually he'll forget about it too. Now I've made a rule to not let anyone take his school supplies. He tends to look at the brighter side of things and I love that about him.  His classmates continue to ignore him and I know I can't force them to like him and I'm not sure if it's worth mentioning it to the teacher because I'm not sure what she can really do about it. Growing up, I was always the weird kid. Nobody was my friend and I got bullied severely. I don't want that for my kid. He said we're best friends but I'm scared that I'm the only friend he has. I don't want him to feel bad about himself. How can I help him? What should I do or say? I feel like his personality is slowly changing because of this. I'm new to all of this. I'm trying to be there and be the mom I wish I had when I was a kid in his position but I would love some feedback. How should I go about this ?",
        "answer": "There's nothing the teacher can do. This is part of most of our shared narrative as autistic people. I had the illusion of friendship from people as long as I didn't mind my boundaries and did what people told me, but as soon as I realized they were taking advantage of me I told them to stop and they decided I was no fun any more. I had very few friends in school, and most of them didn't last very long, and the ones that did... weren't that healthy but I was so lonely I couldn't be dissuaded.\r\n\r\nSpeaking openheartedly, the best thing you can do for your son is to tell him that bad friends are worse than no friends, and that if they're not going to play nice with him that's their loss, not his. Be honest with him and say because of reasons beyond his control -- I don't know if you've told him about his diagnosis or not -- he's going to have a hard time making friends in life, but if he works hard at understanding people -- not just in general but individuals in specific -- the friends he does make will be lifelong companions who will put in the effort to be his friend in return. Tell him that you don't know how many people like that there are at this school, that those kinds of people are rare and far between, like shiny Pokemon, but that if he keeps his heart open and keeps looking for them, he'll eventually find them.\r\n\r\nBless.",

I can\u2019t diagnose but I can say she is probably tired but can\u2019t sleep. I have had similar issues all my life but because I\u2019m an adult now I don\u2019t cry and scream as much, I do still cry sometimes though. \r\n\r\nFor example, I\u2019m tired and sleepy but I can\u2019t wind down. There are often too many sensory issues for me to sleep or relax. I can\u2019t stand textures on my feet. My feet have to be able to be cool (I now use cool packs), and uninhibited. My duvet was causing issues because when I put my foot out to be cool it had texture and I hated that.\r\n\r\nIf there is nothing medically wrong, perhaps there are sensory issues for her.

        "question": "Should two girls (7) be forced to always play with their friend (7F) who has autism? I work at an after-school club for 6-9 year olds and have been trying to navigate a difficult situation. These three girls would often play together but every now and then the autistic girl would come to one of the adults and say the others are excluding her. When we would ask them all why, the two girls would explain they sometimes want to play with just the two of them because the other girl will constantly follow them and has meltdowns if she doesn't get her way.\r\n\r\nI recognize that the reasons they don't want to play with her has to do with her autism, but I really don't know if it's beneficial for anyone involved to force it to happen when two of them really don't want it to. My manager thinks they should be forced, but my instinct says that this will lead to them getting more and more resentful of her and treating her badly when they play. The big issue though, is that these two girls are her only friends and she struggles to approach anyone else to make more friends. So if they don't play with her, she will just be completely alone. They do still play with her every day, just not always all day. \r\n\r\nI'm quite young and not very experienced with children, so I thought I'd ask this sub for advice. Should the two be forced to play with her? And how can I help this girl make more friends?",
        "answer": "Play should never be forced. If you compel the two neurotypical girls to play with the autistic girl, there's a high chance they'll resent her company more.\r\n\r\nIf you want to help the autistic girl make new playmates (or reconnect with the existing ones), then I suggest coming up with a cooperative group activity for all the children to join. Run your idea past the autistic girl first to make sure it's something she'll feel inclined to participate in.",

I don't know what to do Today my boss had a serious talk with me about the constant mistakes I keep making and how it's costing him money and he's losing customers and he's gonna have to fire me if it keeps happening. It's a really small business and my boss is a nice guy so I feel really guilty. This would be my 4th time getting fired in the past 2 years due to this type of thing. I have ADHD, autism and anxiety which makes work basically impossible, and extremely emotionally painful, but I have no choice, I need money to survive.

        "answer": "This might sound bizarre but it worked for me often. I have the same thing, I know when I've got that itch and it felt inevitable (it isnt). I started trying to remove the emotion aspect to it and view it simply in terms of my brain and habit. Your brain has created neural networks that lead you to use whatever substance or activity. You have feelings of sadness, you use, feeling of happiness, you use, until eventually your brain feels hardwired to always use. But it isn't. When you get those urges, try not to panic or get angry or shamed or anything, try viewing it as a signal being shot through your head. The more you use, the more often you'll get those signals. If you view them in that sense I found I had way more power to ignore. And first I'd give myself 10 minutes to ignore, and by then the signals had passed and I didn't want to anymore. the more you can do that, the stronger you make the neural pathway of \"craving --> stay sober\" . And it builds on itself until your brain redirects more and more easily. At first there will probably be times that you will still follow through with using because it's so habitual at that point, but you can see it as a brain malfunction and not shame yourself \r\n\r\n\r\nAnd I'm not saying you aren't hurting, and that it's simply a bad habit. There are reasons we get to that point, but it's a hell of a lot easier to deal with them when you aren't stuck in the cycle of fucking over your brain and body",

        "answer": "Communication is so, so important--and so is self regulation. You did your part by asking her to let you know ahead of time when she's making food, and reminding her regularly is also helpful. I reccomend trying to work through the sensory overload on your own so that when you talk to her next it can be after recovering--trying to talk in the middle of an overload or meltdown will only be more stressful for you, and likely cause an argument since emotions are high and you're more likely to snap. When I get overloaded or sense a meltdown coming on, I take some time to myself and either let everything out or work on stabilizizing and calming myself down (of course thats not always possible, sometimes we just need to cry and stim and deal with everything until it goes away) and then return to my partner after I've recovered enough that we can talk about things calmly. If I try talking while overloaded, it rarely ever goes well and often leads to bad arguments. I highly reccomend taking space for yourself and communicating effectively afterwards!",

I can only cry when I'm too drunk to remember most of it, and the parts I do remember, I know it's a vicious cry - soaking face and clothes in my tears and snot kind of cry. But when I'm sober it feels like my emotions just keep boiling up inside me but never boil over. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPart if what keeps me attached to the alcohol is the ability to just get it out. To cry. To drunk text people the thoughts that have been eating me.

I had almost exactly the same problem\u2026 I couldn\u2019t cry while sober and it felt so frustrating. I couldn\u2019t be lovey or show affection unless I had some drinks in me. I couldn\u2019t even thank someone or give a compliment. Definitely issues that stemmed back to a parent\u2019s alcoholism and irrational, erratic behavior. \r\n\r\nIt took me 6 months of being clean to actually be able to cry. But then, I swear, I started crying at almost anything\u2026 happy things, sad things, just feeling empathy for another person. I started being able to show people in my life that I was thankful for them. It was difficult but I felt like I needed to do it because I\u2019d always wanted to be able to show those people that I was grateful. \r\n\r\nI know it\u2019s excruciating, trust me, I do. But, somewhere along the way, you learned you weren\u2019t allowed to cry and now the only way you can is by ingesting a substance that takes down all your defenses \u2026but it\u2019s also ruining your life. If you stay off of it for long enough, you\u2019ll learn how to feel all those things naturally. It\u2019ll definitely feel awkward, but it\u2019ll be worth it to feel whole again without something that\u2019s leeching your finances, mental health, and relationships. \r\n\r\nAnd I don\u2019t know if this helps, but I don\u2019t really do 12-step. It didn\u2019t really work for me. I use a lot of principles from it and I may go again one day, but it\u2019s not how I got clean or got through my first year. \r\n\r\nGo check into a good rehab program and then find a good IOP program to do for a few months after that. (The rehab will definitely help you with that aftercare plan.) The friends I made in that program have been a really solid support for me these last 14 months. They say connection is the opposite of addiction, and i whole heartedly subscribe to that. \r\n\r\nI hope things get better for you. :)",

They thought I was just an anxious and chaotic person. My own parents don't believe I am autistic and didn't come to the appointment in which it was arranged for them to come in order to understand the details about my condition and diagnosis.\r\n\r\nI am worried that my psychiatrist was wrong for diagnosing me with autism, although my characteristics and traits are very obviously of one's who is on the spectrum and have been with me my whole life. He also explained and showed me the criteria and how they fit exactly with how I have been feeling and what I remember experiencing ever since I was a child.\r\n\r\nMy therapist was the one who noticed my autism first, after many months of visiting her, so I was able to kind of unmask as much as I could and recognise my traits. However, I didn't have a diagnosis from a psychiatrist so I thought I was just faking it. Now I have my autism diagnosed from a psychiatrist and I still doubt myself. That I mimicked autism because of my trauma while my trauma comes from the ways I've been treated due to my autism.\r\n\r\n I am worried that my condition isn't being taken seriously after that much evaluation. People are so quick to tell me I am too weird and rude and unlikeable for the ways my autism presents but still trivialise it in order to call me a faker\r\n\r\nHas anyone else have doubts about their diagnosis even if their autism has been something they have always found distressing?",

        "answer": "Congratulations! AA and ADHD dad of two (ages 8 and 11) here. I understand your fear, but it really is a positive that you know you\u2019re autistic - I wasn\u2019t diagnosed until three years ago. Knowing your diagnosis helps you put your own behavior and emotions in perspective, and can ideally help you adjust accordingly. First of all - just that you care enough to really be thinking about this and reach out here shows you\u2019re a caring thoughtful person. Secondly - you can\u2019t beat yourself up about what could or will happen as a parent. You\u2019re going to screw up, we all do. You\u2019re going to make mistakes, we all do. As someone who is on the spectrum, you\u2019re going to have meltdowns and moments when you\u2019re completely overwhelmed. That\u2019s ok! The key thing is to develop the skill of recognizing when you\u2019re in that state or approaching that disregulated state, and then taking a minute to remove yourself (physically or emotionally - even if just for a moment.) Of course that\u2019s not always possible with a small child, but I\u2019ve found that even just the act of recognizing that you\u2019re feeling disregulated or out of sorts, can help you feel better. Another key thing here - be sure to take care of yourself. Try to find moments or ways to meet your own emotional needs. Again, not always possible with a small child, but do try. Last thing - the beginning is always really tough. Just remember that whatever is happening when you\u2019re feeling at your worst (baby won\u2019t sleep, you\u2019ve been up for endless hours etc) - that won\u2019t last forever. In fact, time will soon fly by. So many people will tell you to cherish every moment, and you may want to punch them in the face at times. But you will look back and remember all the wonderful moments. And there will be so many wonderful moments. \r\n\r\nYou\u2019ll have bad days, but that\u2019s ok. You\u2019re going to be a great mom. You\u2019re going to have a great kid or kids. Again - congratulations!",

        "question": "I have a drug problem I\u2019m not really sure why I decided to come in here, but I feel like I really have no other place to go. I am 22M studying finance/marketing in college. I was adopted when I was a baby and my parents are quite successful. My mother owns a company and my father comes from a very successful European family. They both attended prestigious schools and expect nothing less from me or my older sister. My older sister is a former  5-star athlete and amazing student who has started her own company and is doing masters program in Europe. My grandfather invented a pretty famous product and my father inherited the patent when he was 14 because my grandfather passed away. My father never had a good relationship with his family, aside from his mother. My grandmother was the most amazing person in the world, but that\u2019s a different story. My mother comes from a successful Midwest family and has 8 siblings and our extended family is around 200 people. I am the youngest member of my family and needless to say I have a lot of eyes and pressure on me to be successful. I decided to go straight to college after hs but never really went to class, partied a lot and basically got myself kicked out. My parents were so mad and I ended up moving out of their house, living on my own and working full time first the first time to pay for all of my own stuff. I grew up a privileged childhood and I know I have taken so much for granted and this has put a tremendous strain on my relationships with my family. Growing up my parents never really said no except when it came to drugs and partying. I was never allowed to go to parties until late in hs and I was drug tested throughout hs. This didn\u2019t really stop me too much and I was in trouble a lot junior year. The only thing that was rally stopping me was that I was playimg on a high level soccer team and was being recruited to play at some smaller school. Unfortunately I got hit with a bunch of injuries and that halted my plans for college soccer. When I finally went to school I played for fin but definitely focused on just having. Fun. During the year that I left school, I started smoking weed and drinking a lot. I was working a construction/sales job and was making pretty decent money considering my situation. As the money started rolling in I started getting into cocaine. I was able to hide a lot of my stuff from my parents but I started selling carts and weed and my parents saw my bank transactions and called me out. They told me if I stop and get my shit together and do some online classes they would pay for me to go back to school. So I chilled out a bit and kept my head down and went back to school. That was 3 years ago. I have always had a big social circle and that has been by design. Do this day I\u2019m still not sure what is actually wrong with me, maybe I\u2019m a psychopath or just insanely arrogant but I have a reason for absolutely everthing I do. I make sure to plan my interactions, I choose words and leave out details in order to get stuff out of people. And it works. I don\u2019t know why or how, but I grew up in a upper middle class white family and even though I am brown, I have somehow been granted some version of classism/privilege. My sister is really the only one I talk to about this but she made the note that I one across as always laid back even when the world is burning. We\u2019ll in order to stop me from losing my mind, i have started really just self medicating. I have so many issues with my body, mostly from sports and working construction, but now I know it\u2019s other things too. About 2 years ago I decided I wanted to work out and get back into shape. I started lifting like 10 times a week going 2x a day and just non stop work. I ended up hopping on sarms and it allowed me to push my body to new limits. I\u2019m the end I got hurt because I would use the sarms to numb my body and I would smoke and take preworkout to  push though the pain. I was doing an summer internship at an investment firm and so my and the other interns were always doing adderal, Ritalin, or something to keep us focused. I then started getting back into coke after meeting a mutual friend at a party that deals. We ended up striking up a deal and I could get him into parties and he could sell. After the first few parties I brought him to I got a different kind of high. The high of having power. I can get into that later but basically fast forward to when school starts and me and my friends are buying 8bas every weekend doing a g and then selling the rest at parties. I started moving so much product for my guy that he was giving me free stuff just cuz he knew I would move it. Around this time I started getting into shrooms. I used them as an escape/reset when I was in a bad mental place or just had a lot going on. I have had some amazing experiences and some truly horrifying experiences (i can share) but I started microdosing a lot and would mix it with weed and cocaine. I started getting some crazy trips which led me to Molly, popper, concerta to name a few. I still don\u2019t want to get into anything stronger and acid scares the shit out of me. But basically I am at the point in my life where I am unable to sleep unless I am on something. I hate being with my own thoughts and I have started disassociated from certain things. I almost feel like I can\u2019t distinguish what is real and what is me being high or just overthinking. I cannot tell my family for a variety of reasons. Of course it would kill them and it would mess everthing up. But the other reason is because I have never been doing better from the outside looking in. I am currently in the last rounds of interviews for some big private equity and wealth management firms. I am still dealing and making good money, I live in a party house which has only made me more popular and crave the attention more. But at the same time I feel like I\u2019m stuck in a time loop. Every week is the same. I constantly relive memories. I don\u2019t remember doing school work and yet I am doing good in my classes. I just find time to grind stuff out and I basically just live for the weekend. The reason I\u2019m writing this is because I know that I am so close to losing it. I am currently in love with my best friend and I don\u2019t know how to tell her, I know if I keep doing this amount of drugs I will die, I know that I can\u2019t keep putting on fake smiles and pretending to like people. I have always been able to smile and be nice to people but recently I have felt myself become really mad or annoyed at absolutely nothing. But I have so many people telling me how good I\u2019m doing and how proud they are of me going back to school and landing a good internship. So  im not sure if anyone will actually see this or spend the time reading it, but I\u2019m open to anything. And I have lowkey lived a pretty crazy life and have a bunch of stories I can share.",

This also negatively affects Autistic men due to social awkwardness\r\n\r\n2) I\u2019ve noticed that most of the Autistic women I know irl who are in relationships are with NT men, likely at least partially due to point 1. I wish more Autistic women were open to dating Autistic men.\r\n\r\n3) Autistic AFAB individuals seem to be more likely to come out as trans, nonbinary, genderfluid, etc. which lowers the dating pool for Autistic men who are attracted to women.\r\n\r\n4) Autistics of all genders often prefer to focus our energy on our interests rather than our physical appearance, so we\u2019re often seen as less attractive than NTs\r\n\r\n5) there is very little infrastructure in place for Autistics to meet each other to form both romantic and platonic relationships.",

        "question": "Autism Diagnosis Results - Bad News Hey guys. \r\n\r\nI will omit my autistic traits, behaviours and sensory issues from this post. \r\n\r\nIn short I (26 m) finally after years of waiting have the results from an autism assessment (in the UK). \r\n\r\nSadly I was told I have many traits and I am on the threshold but because I dont have the social side of it I was not diagnosed autistic. \r\n\r\nThis is devastating. Because all through school, college, Uni my jobs I have had crazy anxiety, avoided all social situation, didnt make friends and went onto panic attack and anxiety meds to get through it. \r\n\r\nAfter going on the meds I started working on my eye contact, hand gestures and building up my tolerance to socialising without getting drained so quickly. \r\n\r\nHowever, it is all a mask. But because I have a job and have travelled I was told these are things autistic people struggle with and that also leant them towards not diagnosing me. \r\n\r\nI am gutted. I said to her if I went to every adult autism assessment centre in the UK do you believe 1 would diagnose me. She said without hesitation 'definately' and that each centre diagnoses differently. \r\n\r\nWhat would you guys do in this situation? I could go back to my gp and push for a second refferal and assessment. \r\n\r\nMy brother and cousin are both autistic and were diagnosed as adults. Both of whomb are shooketh I did not get the diagnosis. My mum works with SEN children mostly autistic children. She wishes she knew then what she knows now and would of sent me to get a diagnosis as a child. \r\n\r\nIts also tricky since I identify as autistic already. I was so sure I would be diagnosed. Just didnt realise I talked myself out of a diagnosis by saying I have a job and have travelled.\r\n\r\nAnyway. \r\n\r\nLooking for guidance. \r\n\r\nThank you all.",
        "answer": "From what I'm reading here, they told you that you meet most of the criteria but they couldn't diagnose you with autism because of a lack of a \"social component,\" but you have significant social challenges. It sounds like it's perfectly reasonable for you to question this diagnosis (or lack thereof).\r\n\r\nIf you feel your results don't accurately reflect your social challenges, maybe think back to the questions you were asked. Were there many ways to interpret these questions? Is it possible you answered in a way that reflected your external/masked appearance, rather than your internal experience? I can't be of much help here, as I was diagnosed 10 years ago and don't remember much about the experience. However, I'm happy to help you think through this if there's anything you remember from the process that seemed vague or anything like that.",

I\u2019ve known him since I was 14 (I\u2019m 23 now, we started dating when I turned 21) and he\u2019s always been one of those kids who smoked weed all the time then eventually that turned into taking percocets & xanax. He got in a long-term relationship and had 2 beautiful kids and stopped taking them. Around the time we started dating COVID had hit and he lost his job and he started taking them again. At first I didn\u2019t know, I thought he was just a really sleepy guy (lol). I never knew the signs. At some point we broke up, no contact at all. I found out from a mutual friend that he overdosed and went to rehab. We got back together shortly after. He ended up doing a 4 month jail stint, related to his drug use, in October and when we would talk on the phone it was the most coherent i\u2019ve ever heard him. Everyone was so proud of him and kept reminding him to keep up the good work when he got home. He even converted to Islam which I know to be a peaceful and disciplined religion. He got released on Jan 29th and I just found out a few days ago that he\u2019s been taking xanax again almost every day for the past week. I don\u2019t know what to do, I\u2019ve never experienced this first-hand. I feel like I have to babysit him to make sure he doesn\u2019t take anymore and OD. He\u2019s on 3 year probation and facing 10 years if he violates. I reminded him that even though he hasn\u2019t started getting drug tested yet it could happen any time then he\u2019s going to feds. He says he\u2019s ashamed, he couldn\u2019t fight the temptation. I love him but I can\u2019t stop my life to babysit him. I know he has to want it for himself but I begged & pleaded with him to stop and he said he would. Sometimes I wish I never even found out, I wish he hid it better and I could be blissfully unaware of it. I\u2019ve never been in this situation before but I\u2019ve asked him if he\u2019d go to NA or therapy and he said no. What will it take for him to stop? I thought he already hit his bottom.

My boyfriend (30m) has been using a variety of drugs since his early teens, and has been to AA/NA & rehab before we started dating a year and a half ago. His primary drug of choice is coke & alcohol, and his come downs are awful. His mood swings are all over the place, and when he gets angry it\u2019s explosive. He\u2019s definitely paranoid. His energy when he\u2019s not using is pretty much non-existent. He\u2019ll go days without showering bc he\u2019s so tired, and can\u2019t be counted on for any apartment responsibilities. He just \u201cdoesn\u2019t care\u201d about almost anything. If he\u2019s not working he has no motivation for anything except partying.\r\n\r\nFrom what I know, and have seen, he uses at least weekly. And when he gets going it\u2019s never a bump or two, it\u2019s a full bottle of whiskey and as much coke as he can handle. When he\u2019s not doing coke he will drink an entire bottle just to fall asleep.\r\n\r\nI will partake sometimes but mostly I smoke weed and drink on the weekends. I\u2019ve told him I\u2019d quite everything if that would help. We\u2019ve talked about him taking a break but when it comes down to it, he\u2019s barely slowing down. Much more than when we started dating but it\u2019s still pretty constant. He tries to compare his coke use to my daily marijuana use, and \r\nknow drug use is drug use, but to me a hit mid workday or before bed is just different from him staying up for 24+ hours and then sleeping for 13 hours to recover. I\u2019m worried about it. I\u2019m worried about what this is doing to his body and his mind. It\u2019s not sustainable.\r\n\r\nI just don\u2019t know where to start. He usually throws my weeds use in my face and cuts off the conversation. If anyone has been in his position before what should I stop doing? What would have been helpful?",
        "answer": "You can support him when he decides to take Recovery seriously, that's about it.\r\n\r\nYou can't make him quit or make him want to be sober, it's entirely on him to do that. The best you can do is set healthy boundaries. \r\n\r\nFor example, if I had a night of drinking I wasn't allowed to handle my son for bath time. It wasn't a punishment or anything, just a boundary my wife set for our families safety. But then I had to make the choice to drink and not spend time with my son.\r\n\r\nLook up support groups for friends and families of addicts. I like SMART Recovery, personally. I hate to say it, but it is likely your BF will get worse before he gets better. You can't rely on hope that he'll spontaneously want to get sober and your relationship will improve. That is generally not how these situations turn out... You have to take care of yourself, you can't be a parent to a full grown man who is an addict.\r\n\r\nGood luck",

From years of bad dental hygiene she has thick bleeding gums, and other related dental problems but is terrified of the dentist and doesn\u2019t floss due to the sensations.

From here on whenever I adress women I mean NT women in particular.\r\n\r\n To me it feels like many women uses signals and body language and non-verbal communication much more than NT men. Am I right? I was wondering if anyone else experience this and how you think and what you do about it? Men say what they want directly and girls \"tests\" guys and do more \"game play\" no?\r\n\r\nThe reason for me asking is Ive always struggled with my dating life, and theres many things I need to work on that I know, but Im pretty sure one part of it is my challenges with social skills in general, and reading signals, body language and non-verbal communication in particular. Actually I might be very bad at using signals and non-verbal communication myself even. I am pretty bitter because Ive only faced rejections all my life, but Im not acting hateful or the like on women.\r\n\r\nWhen I approach girls they often seem confused, or uncomfortable.

        "answer": "I think (as an AFAB person myself) something you need to understand is that fear of violence and retaliation is something women/people seen as women live with. \r\n\r\nSo a lot of what looks like being non-direct and 'game playing' is really a person trying to let a man down easy/get out of a social interaction because they're afraid and because men can be very fragile in the ego department.\r\n\r\nAre there people who just ascribe to a weird gendered 'game playing' thing? Sure, but regardless of that person's gender it's best to stay clear of them.\r\n\r\nWhen you approach a woman she has no way to know who you are or which type of man you are. Are you going to get violent? Stalk her? She doesn't know. So she is guarded and some level of uncomfortable. \r\n\r\nThe other thing is that men sometimes act like any woman out in public and not obviously attached to a man is available for the taking/talking to. Nobody wants to feel like prey or one of those sushi dishes on a conveyor belt. Sometimes a woman is just out living her life/running errands/doing whatever and doesn't want to be bothered. A lot of public places aren't appropriate places to approach someone to try and get to know them/indicate romantic interest.\r\n\r\nIf you're just sort of approaching any woman you're attracted to and going for it, then you need to be prepared for the fact that you'll be treated as the potential threat and intrusion that you are. \r\n\r\nThere's no magic solution or psychology book that you can read to learn how to 'win' because women aren't prizes or games or math equations.

I was even interacting with the other works for a short time at one point and everything seemed fine. \r\n\r\nThey asked about accommodations for me and considering they are a social services field I felt like I could open up and get understanding. Once I told them I could feel the judgment in the air. \r\n\r\nSkip to the end, I get a call a week after my first day telling me to not return because issues came up and they all agreed I wasn\u2019t a good fit. I asked why and they said because I took someone\u2019s grapes from the break room (not true, the lpc was going around sharing them with everyone and she offered me one and I took that as kindness and said sure) and the other issue happened when the elderly volunteer kept talking about her grandchildren who have autism and how her other fiends think she could have it and I just sat and listened to her didn\u2019t say much. She also mentioned how when autistic children come in who have experienced abuse it can be very hard to get them to feel safe to open up and take time to bond with them. I agreed and said \u201cyea that makes sense\u201d. What was told to management was that I kept talking about autism to a volunteer and made the volunteer feel like I was being pushy :/ seriously I barely spoke at all. \r\n\r\nSo anyways. All that on my first day and no clients came in so I didn\u2019t even interact with anyone to show what I was capable of in that setting with children and families. When I got the call told them \u201cbut you never saw me interact with the children yet\u201d then they told me \u201cif this is how you treat adults imagine how you\u2019d treat vulnerable children\u201d \r\n\r\nThey were all fine with me socially to where I thought I was doing okay. So I keep wondering if me telling them about autism made them discriminate against me or if there was some small town issue where if I didn\u2019t fit perfectly in their social circle then they wouldn\u2019t want me there and they tied to find reasons to get me out. \r\n\r\nNow I don\u2019t feel like returning their crap because how do you go from saying so many positives about someone after an interview like how intuitive, smart, knowledgeable, and good hearted someone is to saying they don\u2019t belong in that field of work at all after only one day when they didn\u2019t even interact with the children or families. \r\n\r\nWhat do I do?  Return their things and say nothing or send them an email and try to get their reasons for letting me go in writing?",

Articles and such are usually about safe food and textures, but that isn\u2019t the issue. The situation has gotten very stressful for both me and my spouse (who are also both autistic). \r\n\r\nIt seems to only happen at night, never during the day. It\u2019s a rare occasion that it happened durning daylight hours. Tonight is a great example. We made grilled cheese and tomato soup. He usually loves that. It becomes some sort of battle. We\u2019ve tried being stern, gentle, rewarding. No method has been working. He\u2019ll start eating and then he\u2019ll pretend he hates it or that it\u2019s nasty. We make it the same way every time. It\u2019s like this with all foods. We buy the same brands, never switch them. \r\n\r\nIt gets to the point where we just ask him what he personally wants to eat, but once he has it the cycle repeats. Suddenly he hates it or it\u2019s nasty. It\u2019s worrying because we want him to eat, we want him to be healthy. There\u2019s been multiple times that we\u2019ve given up and he\u2019ll fall asleep but wake up in the middle of the night asking for food, he won\u2019t eat it and run a whole day off of 3-4 hours of sleep. \r\n\r\nMe and my spouse didn\u2019t have any major food troubles growing up so we can\u2019t go to our parents for advice.

I\u2019ve been addicted to it for over a year now, but honestly I\u2019ve been abusing any and every substance I\u2019ve ever come across since about 15-16 years old. This is just the hardest substance I\u2019ve become hooked on. \r\n\r\nThings got so bad over this last year (financially, health wise, mentally) that I had no choice, but to move back in with my parents. I\u2019ve been to rehab once before, but when I wanted to go again recently ( just before I moved in with my fam ) I couldn\u2019t find anyone to watch my big dog. He\u2019s a handful, a sweetheart, but just a lot to deal with. My mom is home most of the time, where as my dad is a trucker and is gone for a week or so at a time. With how my dog is there\u2019s just no way my mom could look after him on her own. So yeah, being broke, and not being able to go back to rehab, staying with them was really my only and best option. \r\n\r\nI\u2019ve been here a month, well a month tomorrow, and at first things were going great. I was able to stay clean for 4-5 days. Even though my mom and I have had a rough relationship through out most of my life she has been extremely supportive and understanding. Overall, my environment here with my family has been good, probably the best it\u2019s ever been since I was way younger. \r\n\r\nHowever, I started using again within the first week of being here, and I haven\u2019t told anyone in my family about it because I don\u2019t want to keep hurting them. I also am extremely grateful for everything they\u2019re doing for me right now, and I\u2019m just taking advantage of them by continuing to use when I\u2019m supposed to be getting sober. I don\u2019t even really understand why I keep choosing to do it. \r\n\r\nI\u2019ve only admitted this to my ex, who is still a really good friend of mine, but the constantly lying to my family is really eating me up inside. I don\u2019t know how to be honest with them about what I\u2019ve been doing, and because of that I keep using to avoid thinking about it or feeling all this guilt. \r\n\r\nI\u2019ve felt for awhile now that I\u2019m just not a very good person, because of the choices I make through out addiction. But I feel like I\u2019m getting worse and worse every day, to the point where I don\u2019t even know who I am anymore or how to start trying to be better. \r\n\r\nOne of the things that breaks my heart the most is that I know my mom either knows I\u2019m using still, or at least is noticing that something\u2019s not right with me. But she won\u2019t outright say it. Anytime she\u2019s called me out for it in the past I\u2019ve lashed out on her. I say awful things, put the blame on her or anything else besides me, or I just become completely defensive and end up leaving / cutting off communication with her. \r\n\r\nI feel so awful for doing this to her. And everyone else in my life. I\u2019ve lost and pushed away so many people in my life because I chose to keep using and what it\u2019s turned me into. \r\n\r\nTomorrow, I\u2019m supposed to be 1 month sober. I know that my moms going to praise me for it because it\u2019s been almost a year since I\u2019ve been a month sober (when I went to rehab). Most I\u2019ve been able to stay sober since then is just under 2 weeks. \r\n\r\nI don\u2019t really know the overall point of this ran, and I\u2019m sorry if this isn\u2019t the right place to post this. I just feel really lost right now, and I don\u2019t know how to get out of the mess I\u2019ve created.",

Things that are bad for you and those around you.\r\n\r\nYeah, you're in a mess and that is probably triggering your urges/cravings, which feeds further into bad choices, more messy life, more urges, etc.\r\n\r\nThis isn't unique to you. Every addict knows exactly where you are and what you're going through. You're never alone, no matter how much it feels that way.\r\n\r\nThe good news is that you can make different choices. You got yourself in this mess, and you can get yourself out.\r\n\r\nWe're only as sick as our secrets. You have to be honest with your mother. I suggest talking to a therapist about how to do that in a productive and safe way.\r\n\r\nThis is assuming you're ready to try to recovery. If you're not ready yet, you still might have more messes to deal with and things will likely get worse for you before they get better.\r\n\r\nYou aren't a bad person, and you need to be willing to forgive yourself.

Hello People\r\n\r\nI\u2019m a 30M in the UK and I\u2019ve felt for a good time now that\u2019s there\u2019s something not quite right about me in a social sense and I have no idea what it is.

There are certainly elements of autism that most people can relate to - you can be a socially awkward picky eater who doesn't like loud noises without any disorder whatsoever - but there are some screening tests available online (notably the RAADS-R and AQ test) that will give you an idea of if it's worth bringing up with a professional.\r\n\r\nThe diagnostic process in the UK is to ask your GP for a referral. You'll then be passed onto your local adult autism service for the assessment. As far as I am aware, the wait times depend heavily on the part of the country you live in, with different areas having massively different resource levels. For me, it took the best part of 2 years, from initial GP appointment to diagnosis.\r\n\r\nYou could always go private for shorter wait times, but if you're looking into getting work accommodations (something I highly recommend, even if you don't feel like you need them now) I have heard stories about people only accepting an NHS diagnosis.",

This just feels so surreal and I don't know how to process these feelings. Sorry if this was bad I've just been a swirl of emotions if that makes any sense.",
        "answer": "Sometimes people make bad decisions and do bad things. It\u2019s not your fault for being an old fan of this person, and it really is so heartbreaking when people you look up to or used to support show their true colors. Take a deep breath, remember that you haven\u2019t done anything bad by being an old fan, their behavior is not a reflection of you and you aren\u2019t a reflection of them.,You can\u2019t control how other people act. Focus your energy on things you love that dont have a harmful history. It can be hard to trust creators when one you cared about has been exposed, but there are good people out there for you to follow and connect with. \ud83d\udc99",

After I sent the video I sent a few texts \r\nMy exact words were \u201cNow throw yours away porfas\u201d then \u201cI stop ciggs you stop moonlighting tht bullshit\u201d followed by a gif of Gru and Agnes pinky promising then \u201cCome on if I gotta do something good for me you gotta do something good for you\u201d and \u201cToss tht crap\u201d followed by a Gif of Boosie saying C\u2019mon Man.

I just found something out that is weighing on me terribly out my dad. He (61M) recently had a massive stroke\u2014the majority of the damage was on his left brain. I\u2019m trying to stay hopeful about it but the doctors don\u2019t give me much hope. My dad was my families main provider, which consists of just me (24F), my mom (60F), and the dogs. I\u2019m trying to figure financials out right now and make sure we don\u2019t lose the house he worked his ass off for. My mom is beside herself so I\u2019m trying to do everything I can to help. This whole thing unraveled when I was trying to figure out where he rolled his 401k over to. He had changed jobs at the beginning of last year and I knew that this company didn\u2019t offer a 401k, so it had to have gone somewhere. \r\n\r\nI was scrolling through his bank statements and saw that he was withdrawing quite a bit of money at these two addresses that I ended up googling. Well, he was gambling again. It looked like he had started going to the two casinos nearby and playing FanDuel and what not in June of last year. When I was  younger, he had a really bad gambling addiction. To the point of almost losing everything. My parents almost separated but things worked out, we\u2019ve grown a lot as a family in the past ten years. He had worked so hard on himself to get better. He\u2019d gotten on some medication that really helped\u2014he has been severely depressed his entire life. I snooped too far into his phone and found that he downloaded BetterHelp in August of 2022. He was suicidal and looking for help with his gambling addiction. \r\n\r\nMy dad\u2019s addiction is something I hold a lot of guilt for because I know I should have talked to him about it. I\u2019m literally in graduate school, becoming a social worker. About a year or two ago, he and my mom had started going to casinos together again. They both knew I wasn\u2019t comfortable with the idea, I told them that he had an addiction like anything else\u2014you don\u2019t do them at all, not even in moderation. They didn\u2019t take it seriously. I know my mom didn\u2019t, even when I told her that I saw my dad playing an online casino game on his phone back in the beginning of January. She just said that he was making less with his new job\u2014I know see from his bank statement he was actually making more. I should\u2019ve confronted him. I wish I told him it was okay to talk to me, that I would\u2019ve helped him. There\u2019s so many things I wish I could go back and change :( \r\n\r\nI\u2019m afraid to tell my mom the extent of his addiction. I\u2019m also afraid to look further.

        "question": "Should I take my son out of ABA? This is going to be a long one but I\u2019m hoping to get some other opinions or ideas. My son is 2.5 and has been in ABA for about 3 months. I have never wanted him to be in ABA but it is also the only covered service to give him support beyond his speech therapy and OT for an hour bi monthly that didn\u2019t seem like enough for him. \r\n\r\nMy son has SIB (hitting head or hands against things) pretty rarely but it does happen. He dreads seeing other people out of the house. Sometimes he loves seeing people like some family members coming to the house but for the most part dreads public places. He\u2019s pretty much only been around his mom and dad most of his life. When he\u2019s in the comfort of his home without guests he\u2019s so happy and easy going and so much fun. We know he has sensory processing issues and gets frustrated very easily when out of his comfort zone. He\u2019s also non verbal but his dad and I can understand what he needs 80-90% of the time. \r\n\r\nOur reason for starting ABA was to help him get used to other people and work on communicating better (his speech therapist is old school and not the best. Hoping to find a new one soon). They\u2019re working on that in ABA but have made it clear that for insurance reasons and company policies he has to work on other goals. He\u2019s now working on puzzles, waving, touching his nose, using a hammer, not mouthing objects, clapping his hands, sorting shapes, stacking and sorting cups etc.\r\n\r\nWe absolutely don\u2019t care that our 2 year old can or can\u2019t do these things and I\u2019m not looking for anyone to tell my why those things are important. For my family, right now they\u2019re not important to us. We\u2019re getting tired of therapists coming to a kid that is getting used to new people (which was our original goal) but keep pissing him off by making him do ridiculous tasks to meet a goal quota. \r\n\r\nWith all that being said, has anyone had success with customizing ABA to help with the things he actually needs help with and not random other things that just end up upsetting him? Or should we just pull him out and stick with the bi monthly speech and OT? The only reason we\u2019re debating this is because the bi monthly sessions did not seem like enough support. Also he does seem to be doing better about being around people which is a big deal for him but I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s worth it to continue with the other stressful goals. \r\n\r\nOn a side note, I\u2019m already very reluctant to ABA therapy. This company is the only one I\u2019d moderately trust in our area and that\u2019s with me present for the entire sessions so looking for another ABA company isn\u2019t really something I\u2019m considering. \r\n\r\nTLDR: Has anyone had success with customizing ABA to get rid of stressful goals for your child and focus on what you actually want help with? Or should I just pull him out all together?",
        "answer": "I'm not going to give advice either way, as I don't have a child(although I am an early childhood educator) nor have I personally been in ABA. \r\n\r\nBut, I just want to put it into perspective that it sounds like you're *not* able to customize it at all. \r\n\r\nSo, I'm not sure other people having luck customizing goals with ABA would even be helpful for you as it seems the response was \"no\" for insurance reasons. \r\n\r\nP.s. Besides not mouthing objects(for illness concerns), which is a challenge for typically developing two-year-olds, I'm not sure why any of the other goals you listed would be a prioritized goal in the first place. I'm with you on that. Doesn't feel important.",

What do you enjoy doing in your free time? Do you have a job? Who do you live with? Do you have a romantic partner? Kids?",
        "answer": "Hi - I'm normally a chronic lurker, but I wanted to drop in with the experience of someone who's in their late 30s.\r\n\r\nI currently work in a civil service job that's quite well paid (i.e. I own my apartment and am financially stable). While my work seems boring to some of my friends (data management), I really enjoy the regularity of it and the fact that there are so many set processes to carry out. I live by myself at the moment, but have had relationships previously. I'm not interested in having kids personally, but have nieces and nephews who I really enjoy spending time with.\r\n\r\nIn the past, I didn't like being autistic - it led to me having a lot of social difficulties and I had a pretty miserable time as a teenager. I'd received a diagnosis as a child, which my parents decided was incorrect and pretty much ignored, save for speech therapy. This was extremely unhelpful on their part, and they only told me about the childhood diagnosis when I was diagnosed with autism again in my late 20s. I think with more supports I could have had an easier time as a child and teenager, because I spent so much of it being extremely distressed that I was so out of step with everyone around me. Even my 20s were a bit of a mess, because I kept trying and failing to 'fix' everything that I saw as wrong about myself. The diagnosis really helped me move forward from that point.\r\n\r\nAt the moment, I'm now at the point where I have strategies that generally work for me and let me manage relationships with other people and the world generally (I've been in therapy for about six years). Having my own apartment is also good for managing any sensory issues, since I'm in charge of my own space. I'm currently fairly neutral about having autism; it's just part of who I am, not something to be liked or disliked. It can be tiring for work though, since I have to mask pretty aggressively to fit into the workplace, but I try to take a few long periods of leave each year to relax a bit and avoid burnout.\r\n\r\nIn my free time I generally hang out with my friends and family, travel, and do things related to my special interests (box office numbers and marine life). I'm pretty happy with my life and how things are turning out and feel reasonably fulfilled. I have three people who I would consider best friends and a wider group of friends of about a dozen people, who I met via work, school and hobbies.\r\n\r\nI think your son having a parent who's looking into what having autism can be like and who already accepts him and his interests is going to be so helpful for him as he goes forward. Having that support and understanding from a parent can make a massive difference for quality of life and will help avoid a lot of the 'why am I like this' struggles that I faced until my second diagnosis. If he does end up still interested in machines and electronics when he's older, they're also industries where there's a lot more room for different personalities and ways of working (although hopefully by the time he's thinking about jobs and work, everywhere will be more accepting than it is now!).\r\n\r\nEdit: I should also say that I live in a country with universal healthcare and my work conditions include five weeks of paid time off a year (as well as additional sick leave on top of that), so I'm very fortunate to live where I do and benefit from all of that.",

I am currently in my mid-20s, and I was diagnosed with autism when I was 15-16 years old. I have a friend who doesn't have an autism diagnosis, and they think they are autistic. Although autism is more understood now, I strongly believe there is still a big issue with people struggling to get diagnosed. On the other hand, I also have seen a growing trend of autism and ADHD on TikTok and other social media.\r\n\r\nI have very mixed feelings about this friend because, in one sense, they could potentially genuinely be autistic and I'm just reading the situation completely wrong. However, all they talk about recently is how they are autistic with traditional autistic traits. They also started rocking back and forth in the chair and said that they were stimming. They also believe that nobody thinks they are autistic because they're too intelligent. Furthermore, they talk about autism being 'cute' and 'quirky'.The whole conversations were dominated by my friend talking about their potential autism. It has gotten to a point where im feeling a bit fustrated because they get all their information from TikTok, and they've never once asked me what it's like for me being autistic and how it effects me and my life as a diagnosed autistic person.\r\n\r\nDuring this, I interjected the conversation, and for the first time, I managed to get a word in on how my autism actually affects my life. I mentioned that as an almost non-verbal kid in school, it's taken a long time to feel more comfortable talking around people.

This place is a go-to for people with disabilities, mental illness, and who have bad home lives and I've made a lot of friends with people I really click with. I've been there since halfway through last year and this year we had a whole lot of new kids, one of them is a boy with low functioning autism, his mum comes to the school each day to keep an eye on him in classes, and I guess he's taken a liking to me. I'll try and keep this short but he talks to me CONSTANTLY everyday in class when I'm trying to work and all break. I can't understand what he's saying half the time, his breath smells horrid, and he bothers me so often that I've had major stress and been super tired lately because I get so overwhelmed by him. He's a super nice person but I want him to leave me alone because I can't handle it and even at home when I think about going to school tomorrow I get anxious and my body gets really tense and I want to literally cry because I know he's going to be non stop bothering me. He's super annoying too and I feel really horrible because he's nice and I feel like a hypocrite for being so rude since I'm also autistic and I feel abelist because I know he can't necessarily help it. Most of the time in class, I straight up ignore his presence when he (always) sits next to me so that he eventually stops talking. And at break I usually leave campus or hide out the back/bathroom because he always tries to find me. I feel bad about my treatment, but I try to put my well-being first to improve my mental health and I can't cope well at school because of him specifically, no matter how horrible that sounds, it's true. I want to communicate this with a case manager but I don't know how to without sounding ridiculous or straight up horrible. If you got to this point, sorry this was so long.",
        "answer": "You won't sound ridiculous or horrible. Just say \"he talks to me constantly, it's too much, I just want to be left alone sometimes\". That's perfectly reasonable. It would be better for him to learn not to do this, because he'll continue to push people away otherwise.",

The first specialist said they were going to push for a diagnosis in the report she was sending to the second person who I have an appointment with next week) and I think the way im feeling is probably linked to my likely pending official autism diagnosis.\r\n\r\nWhenever I go to my moms she will try and talk to me, what feels like non stop, the entire duration of the stay. I can't hold the conversation so she just keeps talking and talking doesn't stop. She tells me about every little thing that's gone on in her life, down to whether the delivery person who delivered an Amazon parcel did their job properly or the conversation she had with someone on a phone call to the landlords just to fill the void and not sit in silence.\r\n\r\nEvery time it just leaves me completely exhausted and the result is me not wanting to go see my mom. When I do go to see her, she just ends up getting upset that I don't want to talk to her. It isn't that I don't want to talk to her, I just don't have anything interesting to talk about, and she spends the entire time talking at me anyway so it doesn't give me much chance to add anything even if I wanted to. If I don't go, then she gets upset that I don't want to see her.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the day my mom is just lonely and I don't want to hurt her or upset her. Equally I am at the point where I dread going to see her.\r\n\r\nI don't really know what to do.\r\n\r\nFor info, my mom is aware of me seeing some people for autism but I don't really like going into detail with her on it as she tends to act weird about anything i tell her about and force her opinion on me (not just autism, about everything.)",

I don't know why I am this way. I don't know anybody else who is such a crazy addict. It's my defing trait and everybody knows it. Anything I like I get addicted to it.i went to the strip club once than went two more times that month, I popped a pill last month and then went on a binge for weeks, I relapsed watching porn this week and watched it 4 times today, a girl showed some interest in me and I went home with her even though I'm in a relationship because I'm addicted to attention, she ended up being a total psycho and kinda traumatized me with certain behavior during sex. I'm even scared to actually ask you all for advice because improvement seems impossible. My grandfather, grandmother, mom, dad, uncle .. are all alcoholics and have allot of personality flaws. I feel like I'm the most aware of how toxic and bad the family is but I still can't break out. I started using when I was 14 or 15 and quickly went from weed to heroin( not a gateway drug my ass) I quit opiates and benzos a couple years ago but I relapse every 6 months or so.i moved out young which really enabled my addictions because I've been able to do whatever I want since I was 16/17. I pretty much forced my gf to break up with me by disappearing for days. Because she deserves better. She's actually great and if I was more mature I'd be gaurenteed to have a good future with her. She loves me and saw I was a straight a student and talented at my hobbies and jobs . But I am just so fucking messy and she can't handle it anymore. I do bad things but I know they are bad and they eat at me unlike other family members.ive fealt so icky all weekend since I cheated but I had allot of chances to stop.  I feel like now that I'm single I'm about to go down a really bad path. I have no self control at all and I'm scared to. I'm scared to live a life without all these constant vices and temptations.

I drank every day and could only limit myself by ordering Ubers as I received a double whiskey to force myself from drinking more, and that was rare. 95% of the time I drank to get drunk and if not drinking whiskey would knock back 4 9% Abv beers (equivalent to a 12 pack of bud) a night (150 lb at the time)\r\n\r\nI found aa didn\u2019t help me as I don\u2019t see viewing myself as powerless over it is helpful.

(By the way, we don\u2019t live in the US, and social security is relatively good here.) \r\n\r\nI have accepted his situation for years, but lately realised how unfair this actually is. He thinks that I don\u2019t actually believe the seriousness of his depression and that I just find him is lazy. But he agrees that this is unfair and feels guilty about it.\r\n\r\nWhile I do believe he\u2019s depressed, I mean, I see it every day, I don\u2019t believe it\u2019s a good excuse for not working for years. I understand that after something traumatic you might not be able to work, but we are talking about years in his case.\r\n\r\nI don\u2019t feel good comparing, but I\u2019ve been just as depressed. Still, I\u2019ve worked, because I had to. Even in times after very traumatic experiences.\r\n\r\nHow can I help him, and us? What would alleviate his depression? He has tried meds, but none helped. He has therapy, but I don\u2019t even know if he has talked about this. To be honest, I don\u2019t think this issue is even on his mind. And also, I always give him affection, care, and support. \r\n\r\nAlso, is it unfair for him to not work? Is it unfair for me to ask/require him to work?",
        "answer": "Depression is and can be a debilitating disease and qualifies as a disability. It's a disease of the brain, a trauma or traumas. Part of what makes mental health so difficult is people don't feel like it's serious. Would you look at someone who is quadriplegic and say you don't think the injury to their spine is not a good excuse for not taking a walk? Or someone who has an intense fear of heights not an excuse to not become a utility lineman? Or had he lost his sight, \"How come you can't read your own menu?\"\r\n\r\nI'm not saying people never take advantage of it as laziness and depression can look similar to people. But that people *often* assume laziness or downplay the impacts of depression and anxiety. Mental health sufferers get a ton of ableism.\r\n\r\nAnd yeah there are days I struggle to even get up to take a piss. They're rare but they happen. \r\n\r\nOur brains are hurt and how that manifests is a spectrum. Hope he can find a therapist and medication combo that will at least get him to functional.  Its hard and some traumas never heal. I've had depression all my life to one degree or another.\r\n\r\nIf he enjoys reading you could try getting him a copy of *The Cure for Darkness*, it goes into a lot of science about depression and how it's treated both in terms of medically/psych but also by the wider community.",

        "question": "I can't attend college. I have no future. I guess the title is pretty self explanatory. All this work during my hellish school years seems to be all for nothing, as I'm incapable of doing the one thing it was all leading up to. It's kinda funny in a way. \r\n\r\nThe fact is I'm incompetent. I'm 16 years old yet I can't even take care of myself in the most basic ways. I am heavily dependent on other people. I've tried to work on it so hard, but nothing changes. I forget to eat, bathe, get dressed, go to the toilet until I'm in so much pain and someone reminds me \"Hey [Name] have you done [insert thing I probably should of done] today?\"\r\n\r\nI've tried alarms and stuff but it doesn't work. But that's not even the worst bit. I can't function properly in public on my own. And that's when I'm in secluded areas. My chest gets all tight and I have to grind my teeth constantly and listen to music and carry a special Teddy bear with me and control my breathing and  avoid everyone all while being on the brink of a meltdown and an anxiety attack. It sucks.\r\n\r\nCrowds are a no no. I got kicked outta school when I was 12 because I had a meltdown because of a crowd. I ended up in some alternative provision. There's 30 kids in total In my school. 30. And yet I still have to wear noise cancelling headphones constantly, and I can't go in classrooms with people who aren't my class, can't go in the lunch room, or I completely shut down. \r\n\r\nThat is, if I can force myself in there in the first place. Sometimes I struggle with my class, and there's like 5 people in there. Like damn. I am not very good with this socialising stuff. I can't look at people when they talk and I forget their names. Like it's not even just eye contact. I can't look at their faces. I get afraid to use people's names incase I get them wrong, and I never speak unless I'm directly spoken to.\r\n\r\nIt doesn't help that I go non verbal sometimes, especially when I'm stressed or anxious, which leads to a ton of misunderstandings. A teacher once yelled at me for playing silly little games and mucking about because I had a mini meltdown because my Teddy bear was taken away, (for context I bring that little sucker everywhere with me. I don't know why. It just feels safer when I hide my face in him and he smells safe.) And she put loud gunshots on the board. (Some war movie thing)\r\n\r\nAnd I asked her to turn it down and covered my ears (I couldn't take my hands off of my ears to put my headphones on, because of how loud it was and my hands automatically went straight to my ears) and she said it was gunshots it was gonna be loud. I cried a bit and it was embarrassing, and then next lesson, something was changed and I had a meltdown which caused me to go non verbal for nine hours straight, and cry continuously for seven. \r\n\r\nAnd about college, I gotta take a train. I mean, not to be stereotypical or anything, but I love trains. I think they're pretty cool. But I'm absolutely terrified of being on them. Especially alone. And the gap is horrifying. I don't know why but it's so scary to me. I once had a mini meltdown (what I mean by this is it was more like an internal meltdown. I didn't get violent or lose control I just sorta became unresponsive and non verbal,and panicked a lot, and pulled my hair, and rocked back and forth and stuff) in a train station because they were too loud. And my sister was there. \r\n\r\nMy point is I'm not gonna be able to do this. All my teachers agree that academically, I'm there, 100%. It's everywhere else I'm lacking. And I honestly don't know what to do. I'm not gonna be able to cope in the workplace either. And it fucking sucks because I'm barley functional. I'm supposed to be smart and only have 'mild' autism as people (people I know) call it.\r\n\r\nThe stress of the workplace is a no. I wouldn't be able to cope. I know this because I've been in work environments before, and even though I wasn't working, it was pretty damn stressful. I can't count in my head. Can't do basic multiplication. I can't even tie my shoe laces. Can't throw, can't balance, can't do anything. And sure, these things probably aren't all cuz of my autism. But they're still debilitating and worsened cuz of it.\r\n\r\nAnd now I'm sorta stuck. I can't work. Can't go to college. Can't do much of anything. I feel like I'm doomed to become the disappointment everyone thinks I'm gonna become. And it's not fucking fair. I have dreams. Shit I wanna do. But I can't. And please don't tell me its because I'm not trying. I truly am. It's just so hard, and there are things that I cannot do, no matter how hard I try. \r\n\r\nI try exposure therapy for my anxiety, I try to remember to do basic tasks, I spent a whole two weeks trying to learn how to tie my laces. I walk to school every day and i still react the same way to being outside alone. Heck, It took me almost three years of straight practice half an hour every day just to learn how to bounce a basket ball with one hand (my hand eye coordination is wack) everything is just so hard, and I don't know why. \r\n\r\nSorry for going on so much. I'm just so fed up. I'm described as incompetent a lot. I'm not good at many things. I struggle with almost everything, and I don't know what to do. What am I supposed to do in this situation?  And I know all of this isn't cuz of autism. Some of its just me, I think, but the autism makes it harder, and neurotypical people seldom understand that. \r\n\r\nAny advice would be appreciated. Please. I'm desperate at this point.\r\n\r\nThank you. Have a lovely day.\r\n\r\n[EDIT] thank you everyone for helping Me, I really, really appreciate all of your help and advice, it means a lot. I guess I've just been panicking a lot, because I've only got until May to make my final decision.",

Let me start with this is not a laziness issue or anything like that  \r\n\r\nWe've been married over 10 years and in that time, my wife has never been able to hold a conventional job for long and also be happy. Almost from day 1, the \u201droutine\u201d is what she describes as soul crushing and life sucking. This is to the point that she leaves the house on the verge of tears and won't even kiss me goodbye.  She is so down that you would think she lost someone yesterday but has to go to work. I should note that jobs have been office, retail, farmhand (horses), set hours, shift, and medical related. All sorts except factory work. She is very much the guy from \"Office Space\" but with depression to boot.  She does have PTSD. \r\n\r\nI have always told her that whatever she wants to do is fine with me so long as she is happy and paying her share of the bills but she only wants to work jobs that pay very little and wants to sell art.  \r\n\r\nShe is using medical cannabis grudgingly but refuses any other therapy or medication. (Xanax did help some, but she doesn't like how it makes her feel and her family has a history of addiction issues).\r\n\r\nShe does have a graduate degree and had no problem attending school but does not work in her field. \r\n\r\nI have been as supportive as I can but I can't continue. I need a partner, not a child. I am constantly stressed out and frustrated. I am cooking, cleaning, and working a full time job to give her decompression time to make it easier on her but nothing seems to make a difference.  It is really dragging me down like an anchor.  I can't be happy myself anymore.

I hated traditional work environments and referred to them as soul crushing also, but my issues were probably not as severe as you describe with your wife. \r\n\r\nI would highly recommend therapy, either single sessions or couples counseling. Not sure what her reasons are for refusing it, but it can be very helpful and therapeutic to air your stress and trauma and formulate constructive steps and strategies you each can take so your wife can live her life with more conviction and less worry. And whatever changes or steps forward she can take always remind her that you're proud of her form making those steps. You sound very supportive of her by trying to take a lot of the burden off of her and I hope you guys can find some balance and she can hopefully feel less uncomfortable in the future.

They identify as non binary but (and please don\u2019t hate me) they are functionally a cis man. They behave like a shitty entitled dude, and present in a masculine way in behavior and dress. I will use they/them pronouns for this person but in speech I often slip up. \r\n\r\nThey are in love with me and I do not, and never will, feel the same. We met on Grindr, but I was pretty explicit in that I only wanted friends with other queer people. They said this was perfectly fine and ok. We hung out for weeks. Turns out, the whole time we were friends, they thought we were dating. I cut off contact after that. When I cut them off, they really took it hard.\r\n\r\nFast forward five years later. I meet them again through a mutual friend. I think that since it has been so long, we can give another try at being friends. They\u2019re about to become homeless so after we talk for a few weeks, I offer to have them move in with me and my girlfriend. My girlfriend and I are poly, and I ask if that\u2019s ok with him since we sometimes have other partners over.\r\n\r\nTwo months later they move out. Why? They\u2019re pissed that me and my girlfriend are not having sexual relations with them. They said it was unfair to \u201cleave them out\u201d of a \u201cpolyamorous household.\u201d They say they \u201cnever would have consented to this.\u201d They act like we are violating their consent by not sleeping with them. We had to find a new room mate at short notice.\r\n\r\nWhen they moved out, they continued to send me love messages for weeks, and I felt extremely bad for them. When they moved out they made references to wanting to commit suicide out of loneliness. I did want to be their friend but the way they\u2019re treating me is extremely creepy and unwanted. This person is still messaging me.\r\n\r\nWhat should I do? Keep in mind this person is highly reactive, very emotional and idk what they\u2019re going to do to me if I am explicit in my rejection.
