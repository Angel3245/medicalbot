        "question": "Why suicide is bad? Maybe no one will see this question, but I'm left with taking the risk of asking. I have researched on the internet, reading books among other things. What I'm trying to find out is why suicide implies something bad for the person who commits it, leaving aside that we know the basics, like for example that they shouldn't do it because there is a solution and all that.\r\n But what I see is that the consequences only cover what their close social circle feels, despite this it is not clear to me why people are so against it, and I also don't understand the messages of all the campaigns out there, I would like to see other points of view to understand.",
        "answer": "low effort reply but: suicide must be largely frowned upon by the collective, partially because suicide being perceived as a bad thing leads to fewer people initially considering it. if suicide is neutral, it becomes more normalized, and thus becomes a more accessible point of consideration for some people. a lot of people who kill themselves would have gotten better if they had not. \r\n\r\nalso, most suicides are ultimately a product of material conditions. scores of people who are struggling (money, healthcare, addiction, employment) should not just disappear - they should be noticed, and their recoveries should be supported via structural change. when society/government fails to help individuals thrive, this collective pain should serve as a call to action. if people can simply kill themselves and this *isn\u2019t* an inherently bad thing, then there is far less reason to demand that material conditions improve for everyone.",

Is the overstimulation of my brain making things worse, or is it only a temporary thing?",

On a scale of 1-10 with 10 being the worst, i\u2019d say it\u2019s a 7. The causes are loneliness (attachment issues), fear of rejection, and lack of confidence (voice, short attention span, lack of discipline, feeling behind for my age). I don\u2019t have many friends. I enjoy doing things like blogging, hanging out with people, discussing controversial topics, working out, and watching movies. however, i don\u2019t do these things often because depression makes me lazy. the only thing ive been doing consistently is going to the gym (2-3 times a week). it feels nice but doesn\u2019t help with depression. \r\n\r\ni know i\u2019m capable of so much but i\u2019m also really hard on myself whenever i mess up. i care so much about what other people think of me. \r\n\r\nSometimes, i don\u2019t feel depressed, especially when talking to family or friends, but that\u2019s probably because i\u2019m suppressing it. When i\u2019m alone or mess up in front of people or unintentionally do something to hurt someone (especially the person i\u2019m attached to), i feel it again. \r\n\r\nI\u2019d like to know how to overcome depression without going to a therapist? i WANT to do therapy but my parents don\u2019t believe it works. they told me to talk to them about depression but i have a hard time opening up. it\u2019s easier for me to open up with friends but i don\u2019t know, i don\u2019t want to be a burden. i don\u2019t want them to carry the weight of MY problems. also, talking to someone only feels good for a brief moment. once those negative thoughts and feelings resurface, i fall back into depression. it\u2019s really hard to change, it requires a shift in mindset and a shit ton of effort. I understand that it\u2019s a gradual process. \r\n\r\nSo just in case i fail at convincing my parents, i\u2019d like to know how to overcome it on my own.

        "question": "How do you guys deal with too many things happening at once? I (35 m) live in Brazil, and if you saw the news that already says something about my mental health.\r\n\r\nI lost my job at the start of covid - was temporary. After a few months looking in vain for a new job, as no one was hiring, I decided to study again. Started learning Python, applied to public university, which is free, for a second graduation and was approved. I'm currently enrolled in an IT course in uni.\r\n\r\nI also started streaming to try a little income. It's a great experience and I love doing it, but it is very tiring.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile my wife was getting her salary and paying our bills, but this year she's been cut from her research until April, which means she'll only get paid in May. That never happened before and is the result of the incompetent and malicious administration of the former government.\r\n\r\nI do have a few freelance things I'm working on, in Python, but not enough to sustain us. But we also have some money in reserve, so it will be harsh but if everything goes ok, we'll survive.\r\n\r\nI'm still looking for a job, but now I have do dedicate a lot of time to uni and to learning.\r\n\r\nAlso I have a health problem that makes me sick in semi random intervals of time, around one or two times a month. When that happens, I may or may not start throwing up. That destroyed my confidence to look for presencial work, I'm focusing on remote job hunting because there's no way to know when I'll not be feeling well.\r\n\r\nThis health problem should have been treated already, but due to bureaucracy and some management errors, my treatment stopped. I'm in a queue to go through surgery, which should solve the problem, but now I can just wait. I'm thinking about restarting treatment, going to another doctor and all that, but the money we have is precious little for our necessities.\r\n\r\nAnd I'm afraid of the surgery. A relative of my wife went through the same surgery, for the same problem, and died in ic a few days later.\r\n\r\nI'm doing therapy, my therapist gives me huge discounts to guarantee I'll keep seeing her. She's focusing in traumas I have regarding my parents. They are still alive, they are narcissists and they abused me, verbally, mentally and in some cases sexually, when I was a kid.\r\n\r\nI also have depression since I was 12.\r\n\r\nMy father in law has been diagnosed with cancer in December. My in laws are the people who basically pay our rent, so we have a place to live and can keep studying.\r\n\r\nI think all I can really do is focus in doing my things, study and take care of myself to hope and try to aquire some financial stability. But I'm having problems organizing a routine. There's too much in my head. Some days I just want to be in bed and pretend nothing exists.\r\n\r\nI'll not enter in details about depression right now, but yeah.\r\n\r\nSo, how do you deal with too much on your head? Someone has some tips about how to better organize, or anything?\r\n\r\nThanks",

I did the tests multiple times.\r\n* I researched how autism presents itself in woman and I related to them.\r\n* This all happened during the course of 2-4 months.\r\n* I did not do a full assessments regarding whether or not I have autism, the two online tests that I took sent to me from my therapist.

This was from a psych book that is trust-worthy.\r\n*  My end goal with this post was not to determine or talk publicly saying I am autistic (cause of fear that maybe I am spreading misinformation).

        "question": "Mom of teen seeking insight into my child\u2019s symptoms Concerned mom of teen - looking to learn from experiences of others\r\n\r\nI am a mom, and my oldest daughter is 17, nearly 18. She is a wonderful young person and the light of my life. For the last few years, she has been struggling openly with anxiety and depression. I have taken her to a few psychiatrists and she also sees a talk therapist regularly. She\u2019s been so far on only a few different SSRIs and is now on Zoloft, which seems to be working just a little bit better for her than other meds. Over the past year, her mental health has gotten even worse though and she\u2019s been quite vocal to me about her feelings of helplessness and wanting to get better. I am trying to do everything I can to figure out exactly how to help. She has a lot of signs that she believes may be autism. We do have lots of autistic people in our family, so this isn\u2019t a wild idea. She didn\u2019t have any of the typical early childhood symptoms though, but due to her own social media research, she thinks she may be autistic because if her feelings of burnout, need to stim for self soothing, dislike of certain textures and sounds, etc. I am open to this possibility but want to make sure we investigate all possibilities.\r\n\r\nWhat my concern is, is that she may actually be showing signs of early schizophrenia. If this is the case, I would like to get the right interventions in place before a major episode of psychosis potentially causes big problems for her. Here is why I am questioning whether this could be the case: 1) she says she sometimes hallucinates flies, as in she sees flies that she later realizes are not real. 2) Her mental health symptoms get worse at night. 3) She has lots of intrusive thoughts that really upset her, such as thoughts of grisly violent things, harm happening to people she cares about, imagining her beloved cat is dead, etc. I know she must have lots of disturbing intrusive thoughts about herself doing bad things, because she cries a lot that she is a bad person. 4) she admitted she did a very large amount of psilocybin mushrooms at one time (first time user and didn\u2019t know she was using too much) last year and said she had lots of hallucinations when she did it, and that she still gets vivid flashbacks of this. 5) she has paranoid thoughts and fears sometimes about things like there being people in the walls or attic. 6) she gets really upset about things sometimes if she makes a mistake like spilling a bowl of food and then she hits herself and talks about self harm. \r\n\r\nI am not sure if these might be early signs of schizophrenia or not. I have tried to do research and read some people say that hallucinations of insects were their first signs. I don\u2019t know how long it takes to go from that to big breaks in reality though. Can anyone share your experiences with me? I just want to help her but am not sure how. I am NOT expecting or asking for anyone to attempt to offer a diagnosis, obviously. What I am interested in is hearing from people with schizophrenia as to what your first symptoms were and how long did it take from those to first episode of psychosis? Also, if anyone with a diagnosis other than schizophrenia has had these same types of symptoms, what is your diagnosis? I am still working on finding the right professionals to take these things seriously and I would like to do my own research to take to the professionals as well and just to be more enlightened as to what might be going on.

Hi at first I\u2019ll admit that I\u2019m writing this post after seeing something triggered my trauma very hard. \r\n\r\nSo to begin with a about two years ago I survived a 3 years long cycle of being both mentally and sexually abused by my girlfriend who was supported in the entire thing by her family (entirely female), also a lot of this came to be with them weaponising toxic patriarchal standards and stereotypes. This entire thing really badly skewed my view of women. \r\n\r\nAs someone who was always big on not generalising people and viewing everyone as an individual I somewhat overcame it in day to day basis to the point that I have no problem with the fact that most of my friends are female. \r\n\r\nBut still as a rather progressive left-leaning person I often visit internet spaces which are also frequently feminist spaces. And giving examples from Reddit (I won\u2019t give the exact subs names) I\u2019ve seen a lot of discussions about male abuse, mental health and effects of toxic masculinity on them. And unfortunately I\u2019ve seen a lot of women commenting (and being highly upvoted) things like \u201cthose problems are caused mostly by other men\u201d \u201cwomen are still most affected\u201d \u201cit\u2019s not our job to do anything about it\u201d today I even saw a comment (with 100+ upvotes) about how a man can\u2019t even be raped, and causes of man being SA by a woman are so rare that they aren\u2019t even worth taking care about. \r\n\r\nAnd I\u2019ll admit that seeing things like that triggers something in me and al that calm logical non-generalising thinking about which I talked about and which allows me to normally and friendly interact with women gets thrown out the window, and In filled with I m not sure how to exactly describe it but with some kind of mix of anger and extreme fear and resentment, feeling that that\u2019s how everyone views my experience and that what was done to me is somehow excusable or viewed as unimportant by most women. \r\n\r\nI\u2019m sorry if what I\u2019m writing is a bit of an incoherent rambling but I\u2019m not in a really good place right now\r\n\r\nI wanted to ask if anyone experienced similar feelings/issues with any group of people (not exactly women) caused by their trauma, and if you did, how do you dealt with it?",
        "answer": "Yes I have experienced exactly that and have even been banned from the lgbtq+ community for talking about my rape story publicly and one of the mods found it offensive because \"men can't be raped\". I don't understand the world view of a person like that or what kind of mental gymnastics you must undergo to find yourself in that level of self-brainwashing. I also was banned on the LGBT community for asking a simple question that wasn't offensive but I won't get into any of that because of how unrelated it is. However still I feel the need to mention it because of just how volatile that community can be when it all seems like they just want to stroke their offended ego instead of having actual conversations that are productive.\r\n\r\nHonestly the only way to deal with it is to advocate for yourself even when you experience backlash and to learn how to grow a thicker skin as harsh as that sounds but that is what I have found I must do in order to change anything. I know that sounds harsh to say but it is the lesson I learned because people on the internet are not going to be nice to you and if you want to survive it you must learn how to not let it get so far under your skin. It unfortunately will always affect you or at least it still does for me, maybe one day that will change. I really don't know if it will change but all I know is staying quiet is the worst thing that you can do because it only serves to validate what they say if men like us stay quiet about these things.",

I can check the box with every of the 9 traits of BPD(1 is kinda maybe because i don't remember or notice it but it's more probable that it is true), does that mean i do have it?\r\n\r\nI know there is something wrong with me i just don't know what i haven't visited a professional YET, i plan to go get diagnosed and get therapy for my problems.\r\n\r\nI'm not going to self diagnose i am just wondering if that means that i actually might have BPD?",
        "answer": "The thing with personality disorders is that most people will be able to check the symptoms as they are, usually, things that everyone can experience. It becomes an issue when these things take an impact on your day to day functioning. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, I don't know your age but what I describe above (being able to tick off the symptoms) is particularly prevalent around puberty due to the influence of hormones - for this reason the BPD diagnosis is rarely given to anyone under the age of 18.\r\n\r\nEssentially, just ticking off the symptoms does not mean you have it, and self diagnosing can be difficult when it comes to mental health for a variety of reasons. However, don't let this hold you back from seeing a doctor - if you feel there is something wrong you know you the best, and the earlier you get treatment the better the prognosis. Good luck!",

        "answer": "It depends on where you are. Do you have parents that take your health seriously? Start by going to them. They can and most likely will help you access resources. If it is impossible for you to safely address this with your parents (they\u2019re abusive, etc), then does your school offer counseling services? Ask them about the nature of the services and who provides them. If you feel comfortable with them, do that. You can find another adult you trust as well, like a family member, friends\u2019 parent, or teacher.\r\n\r\nDo you have health insurance? If you do, you can call the customer service number on the back of the card and ask them what providers you can access near you. Please know that they send service summaries every few months by mail, so your parents might find out about it like that.\r\n\r\nIf you dont have health insurance, call places like Planned Parenthood and ask about resources.\r\n\r\nAgain, you absolutely should talk to your parents if the only thing holding you back is  feeling embarrassment or feeling scared of disappointing them. Im only suggesting alternatives in case speaking with them places you in an unsafe situation.\r\n\r\nThis article seems like a great resource and does a much better job of offering advice than I am: https://www.rethink.org/advice-and-information/about-mental-illness/learn-more-about-symptoms/self-harm/\r\n\r\nYou can and should seek help. There is no reason for you to bear the weight of this on your own. Things can and will get better. You are already taking steps in that direction by recognizing you have a situation, and that you need help to address it. Take the next steps. Future you will be very grateful.",

        "question": "Couple of Questions I found this and found it a bit confusing. Someone close to me is autistic and I would consider them to be a 1 on this scale in terms of support required. For those who would consider themselves the same:\r\n\r\n1. What are your views on relationships and intimacy?\r\n2. Have any of you been diagnosed because you were overly socially interactive?",
        "answer": "This chart is simplistic to the point of being useless. The level system such as it is, is pretty subjective and meaningless anyway. It's arbitrary and required by American insurance companies to make it easier to decide who does and doesn't get certain support. It has nothing to do with how autism is actually experienced, the true needs of the individual or the impact autism has on someone's day to day life. The chart takes something that's already overly simplistic and simplifies it further to the point of meaninglessness.\r\n\r\n It's sexist too, it minimises autism that's more typically experienced by women by emphasising the elements that are visible to an outside observer. Having autism that is less immediately obvious doesn't mean it's experienced less severely by the individual, all it does is turn it into an arms race and pit individuals against each other in a bid to get inadequate support. \r\n\r\nThe way it inevitably functions as a system is that people labelled as \"level 1\" have little to no access to support because their needs have been minimised to the point of pretending they don't exist and people who have been labelled as \"level 3\" suffer due to low expectations and the assumption that visible autism automatically equates to a limited intellectual capacity. They're essentially functioning labels with a badge job. No systemic change to the understanding of autism has happened in the medical and psychiatric community, they've just relabelled the old labels for the convenience of lumping all people who look similar into one bucket; refusing to acknowledge that each person is unique, with unique goals and needs. Effective support must be tailored to each person, with funding available to meet each person's unique needs.\r\n\r\nI'll get off my soapbox now. I'm not ranting at you op, I'm just irritated by the way autism is categorised.",

I just really need help finding the motivation to clean is there anything I can do to motivate myself?",
        "answer": "one way i motivate myself to clean is by getting rid of this view that you have to do it in specific steps and that you have to do it all in one go. you could throw away the rubbish thats on one side table and be done for the day, you can pick up the clothes off of the floor and decide what is clean and what isn't, you can put one piece of rubbish away, then put a t shirt away, then wipe something down, then throw another piece of rubbish away. just do anything you can at that exact moment. i do think a bit of tough love with ourselves is okay too, but try and think of it as \"i feel gross, that isn't a good feeling, i'll feel less gross if i take this trash out\" rather than going down the route of just putting yourself down. cleaning is a very difficult thing for a lot of people, but you deserve a nice space to wake up in the morning and you deserve the satisfaction you'll get from trying to make that for yourself. good luck \ud83d\udc96\ud83d\udc96\ud83d\udc96",

        "question": "Crippling embarrassment over insignificant things? I frequently subconsciously \u201cdaydream\u201d about things I have done in the past that I find embarrassing or annoying and it literally makes me want to die. These are unsubstantial things that probably no one else remembers about me but they absolutely haunt me. Does anyone else experience this? How do you cope with it?",
        "answer": "It's common for people to dwell on embarrassing memories because they can be emotionally charged. I personally have had this happened to me many times, mostly in periods of my life where my anxiety was more heightened.\r  \r\n\r  \r\nOne way to cope with embarrassing memories is to practice self-compassion. This means being kind and understanding towards yourself when you have these thoughts, rather than criticizing or berating yourself. It can also be helpful to remind yourself that everyone makes mistakes and has moments they're not proud of. It is not worth thinking too much about those moments, I promise you everyone has had embarrassing moments.\r  \r\n\r  \r\nAnother strategy is to reframe the memory by focusing on the positives. For example, if the embarrassing memory is from a social situation, you might remind yourself of the friendships or connections you made in that situation, rather than dwelling on the specific mistake or embarrassment.\r  \r\n\r  \r\nYou can also try to distract yourself when you find yourself dwelling on an embarrassing memory. Engaging in activities you enjoy can help you build more confidence, and this confidence will counteract or override the feelings of self consciousness over these memories. Focusing your time in and effort on practicing a hobby or doing a pleasant activity is key,  because you will feel better afterwards with yourself too. Personally this is what helped me the most to stop dwelling in awkward memories. \r\n\r\nI hope this helps!",

I\u2019ve started CBT again and my doctor is discussing the possibility of anxiety medication as I suffer from debilitating over thinking (not diagnosed with anxiety). Has anyone\u2019s over thinking calmed down or subsided since taking anxiety meds?",
        "answer": "Yes. I was having cbt and counselling because I just felt so flat and awful. I'd go out to netball training get there burst into tears then leave because I just couldn't go in and interact with people. After about 6 months of talking therapy and cbt, I still randomly felt awful, and the therapist caught me on one of these days. He was worried about me, and I said there's nothing else to talk about, I don't know why I feel like this I know my life is good and my past is behind me but I feel so upset for no reason and think about dying. He called my gp right away, since I've been on fluxitine. I feel so much better, and I haven't had one of these episodes where I just have to leave a social event. And if I do feel a bit nervous I just tell my self most people do suck it up bitch get  yay living or get busy dying. I'm 30 now. I feel lucky I've reached that attitude at this age. I know so many women I speak to don't get to that stage until they are about 50. I just don't give a damn about stuff like that anymore. No one in the gym is watching me, and if they are so what probably jealous or watching my form or maybe they are lonely and want a friend. I feel great. Honestly, it's bit of give and take you gotta want to take the mess and want to get better, and tell your self you will get better, I took about a month for mine to really help. But as long as you recognise yeh this is me I need help and I'm gonna take that help and use it to live my best damn life. You can do it. There's a great little book called the little book of cbt and you fill in the activities it really helped me too. Good luck! You got this.",

        "question": "My son is hallucinating at night My 9 yo son has been having an issue for the past week with hallucinating as he\u2019s about to fall asleep or sometimes when he\u2019s waking up in the middle of the night. He has never had anything like this before. When it happens, he\u2019s so terrified and panicked and he just keeps yelling for me to help him. I can usually get him out of it by taking him to the shower or something else to change his surroundings, but he says everything is \u201csmall\u201d for a while afterwards and then eventually goes back to normal.\r\n\r\nThe hallucination is mostly auditory and he says it is triggered by his breathing, the sound of his covers moving, or any other soft noise like that when everything else is quiet. Once it starts, he says it\u2019s like a whisper screaming that keeps getting louder. The whisper scream was saying negative things at first like \u201cthat was so easy, why couldn\u2019t you do that bro\u201d and stuff like that, but I don\u2019t think he always hears distinct words. He also explained a bit of a visual that sometimes goes along with it, but he only sees this with his eyes closed. He said it\u2019s like a game where two balls come together and then the negative voice starts. It\u2019s not always the same and seems to be evolving a bit. He starts crying and freaking out when this happens saying \u201chelp me mom\u201d and \u201cwhy is this happening?!\u201d. His vision is affected afterwards for a short time with everything looking \u201csmaller than usual\u201d to him.  It\u2019s been almost every night for the past week. It started last weekend and he thinks it\u2019s connected to watching the movie Spirited Away. \r\n\r\nThe best nights are when I give him benedryl (did two nights) and I do a meditation with him to get him to sleep. The benedryl seems to keep him from waking at night where it would start again. But tonight, no benedryl and he woke up twice hearing the thing and completely panicked worse than ever before. I was able to help him after a shower to get back to sleep eventually. \r\n\r\nI\u2019m lost and scared for him. I don\u2019t know what kind of doctor to start with for this, but we need someone\u2019s help asap. Do I need a psychiatrist? Neurologist? Therapist? I\u2019m so lost and afraid. I don\u2019t know how serious this is. Our health ins sucks and not a lot of docs take it. Do I talk to his GP? \r\n\r\nOutside of this, he\u2019s a completely happy, smart, strong & independent kid. He has friends and makes friends easily. He is doing well in school and loves soccer and basketball. Nothing traumatic has happened to him and our family is solid and loves him and his older brother with all our hearts. \r\n\r\nVarious people in our family have had issues with anxiety and depression. My son has also panicked before about being afraid of throwing up. \r\n\r\nCan someone give me some direction, insight, a starting point, anything?  Thank you so much. If you need any other info, I\u2019m happy to answer questions.",

A few of my friends have spoken before about how they have never seen me cry and I just say \u201cI\u2019m not really a crier.\u201d but the truth is I can\u2019t really cry. On the extremely rare occasion that I do cry, I don\u2019t feel anything whilst doing it, I don\u2019t feel sad, to be honest it\u2019s probably just hormones making me emotional. I really just wanted to know why I\u2019m so emotionless and wondered if anyone else experiences this.",

Just keep taking them and if it needs to be increased or another medication needs to be added in combination then cross that bridge with your doctor when you get there.

I hit a point where I just knew that smoking weed every day was holding me back from living the life I wanted to live so in Spring 22 I made the effort to stop weed and did pretty well(164 days out of the year) for me considering I had been an almost daily weed smoker since I was 14. I am back on the straight and narrow (24 days sober) and I am very happy with all the things sobriety is giving me however, I feel like it might be nice sometime in the future to be able to smoke or take edibles once or twice a monthish. I do really enjoy the effects of cannabis when I do it every once in a while for it puts me in a very creative realm which is great for playing music and such, but I hate what it does to me when I use it every day.

Yet, the memory of the initial situation or stimulus making me anxious seems to stick with me.

You didn't make me sad, it just happens sometimes and being alone makes me feel better. I'm not mad at you and will always love you. Maybe when you come over again, I will be feeling better and we can play.\" If she asks why you're sad just say \"I don't know. It just happens sometimes.\" \r\n\r\nKids aren't dumb. If you're chronically depressed, she's going to know that something is going on with you. You don't have to give her a lesson in mental illness to express how you feel sometimes.",

I have heard many times that if you are \"clean\" for a good length of time and then relapse; the addiction comes back immediately. Is this true? Or is that simply a result of the mental desire that caused the relapse in the first place? \r\n\r\nI have a history of substance abuse myself, but I've never been physically addicted to anything more than caffeine and nicotine. I've \"relapsed\" on the caffeine many times and not had much of a problem with the \"physical\" addiction (except fatigue from withdrawals). As far as the nicotine, once I finally came clean of that; I never looked back. \r\n\r\nIn short: If you relapse after being clean for a decent length of time (a year, for example), does the physical addiction automatically return? Or does it simply feel that way because the mental desire caused the relapse?",
        "answer": "Depends on how long you've been using for but opiates, at least in my own experience, it takes me no more than 3 days to be physically addicted again. I was using for a long time though so others miles may vary. If I ever decide to treat myself I never use for any longer than a day and even then I still get a very slight withdrawal. I know others experience the same with alcohol as well, and benzos for that matter! Personally I don't get physical withdrawals from caffeine or nicotine only mental ones which don't last particularly long.

        "answer": "\"Going nonverbal\" isn't really a real medically documented thing, it's just the way some people like to describe selective mutism, which is a medically documented condition unrelated to autism. Nonverbal in regards to autism means someone born without the ability to speak at all or they are only able to use an extremely small vocabulary at all times. You can't really \"go\" nonverbal from being perfectly verbal, it's either you're born with nonverbal autism or youre born with the ability to speak. There is no in between. A nonverbal autistic person can not speak because of a condition called apraxia of speech which is caused by severe autism and severe developmental deficits. Apraxia of speech can not come and go, it's not a spectrum, it's either you have it or you don't. If you have apraxia of speech you can not talk at all ever or you have an extremely limited vocabulary at all times. \r\n\r\nIf you are normally able to speak but in some moments you cant, you don't have apraxia of speech, you aren't nonverbal, it's not caused by autism, you just have selective mutism. I honestly don't really like how autistic people who do not struggle with apraxia of speech have co-opted the term \"nonverbal\" as if it can be compared to nonverbal autism caused by apraxia of speech, when it's really just selective mutism unrelated to autism. \r\n\r\nSelective mutism isn't caused by autism or developmental deficits, it's a condition caused by anxiety and it can occur in anyone, not just those with autism. It is just very common in autistic individuals due to social anxiety being so commonly comorbid. Search Google for selective mutism if you want to find info about this.",

I\u2019ve been going for a little over two years after I had a mental health episode that landed me in the hospital, and she\u2019s the only therapist I\u2019ve ever had on a consistent basis. \r\n\r\nWhen I first started going, I know my parents had access to my information because of the recency of my treatment at the hospital. But now I\u2019m 17, and I don\u2019t want my parents to have access to this info. I don\u2019t remember signing any releases, but it was a couple years ago. Further, my mom works at the hospital, and she\u2019s been friends with my therapist for several years. My parents pay for my therapy if that matters. \r\n\r\nAnyway, sometimes I share something with my therapist and then it seems to come up in conversations with my parents. Like maybe they won\u2019t bring it up directly and it may be a few days after, but it\u2019s always a little weird when they do. \r\n\r\nI don\u2019t want to stop therapy, and I think I\u2019m better because of therapy. That said, I need to protect my privacy. \r\n\r\nDoes it sound like I\u2019m overthinking? If I ask my therapist about it, will that impact my relationship with her? Should I ask my parents about it? I don\u2019t way to accuse anyone of anything, I just don\u2019t know what to do.\r\n\r\nI\u2019m just going to add that my parents have been worried about my mental health. I\u2019m nowhere near where I was when I was 15, but my parents frequently ask me about it. It actually played a role in the university I\u2019m going to since my parents don\u2019t want me going somewhere far away. I\u2019m literally going to a state university that is about 20 minutes away from them.",
        "answer": "Even as a minor, your therapist should not share details about your sessions with your parents. From a professional standpoint, this violates the therapist/patient relationship. It's also a conflict of interest for your therapist to be friends with your parents. It doesn't matter whether your parents pay for your therapy; you have the right to keep your therapy sessions private.\r\n\r\nYou're not overthinking. Maybe this therapist isn't telling your parents everything. Your parents may be bringing up things from your therapy sessions due to queues you're unconsciously giving or out of coincidence. I would still strongly consider switching therapists. You should have a therapist that isn't a friend of your parents and is outside of the hospital network that your mother works for.\r\n\r\nIf your therapist is a professional, they will keep their emotions out of the equation and encourage you to do what you think is best for your mental health. Even if they're perfectly innocent of what you think might be happening, the fact that you think it is happening is damaging enough to the therapist/patient to warrant finding a new therapist. You need to be able to feel comfortable telling them anything without fearing the judgement of others; you can't do that if you suspect that they're telling your parents everything.",

You fucked up, yes, like many others and I. However, does it mean you just quit and go right back to where you started on your journey, fuck no! You having a period of sobriety shows yourself that you have the motivation inside of you to find that best version of yourself.",

        "question": "After obessing over one person for a few months, I suddenly loose interest Over the last couple years I have noticed a repeating pattern of me meeting new people, starting to really like them and ONLY wanting to hang out with SPECIFICALLY them. Like I just cannot wait for them to text me and I want to be with them and talk to them for days nonstop, but after on average 6 months, I suddenly loose all interest and I could not care less if I lost them as a friend/ lover.\r\n\r\nBasically I am obsessed with one person for months and then it just stops.\r\n\r\nIt does not mean that I do not like them anymore, but I do not obsess, I never write them first and only interact with them when they contact me first. Almost like I forget about them while they do not interact with me. I still have fun with that person and enjoy their company while around, but as soon as we part our ways to go home, I do not care if we never meet again. I just do not have feelings... I dont know how to explain it or how to put it into words tbh...\r\n\r\nDoes someone have similar expirience? Is this normal? I would be grateful for any answers because I am not sure if something is wrong with me or what exactly the problem could be.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance :)",
        "answer": "First, I applauded you for wanting to better yourself.  I have been the victim of men, who have \u201clove bombed\u201d me in the beginning, and then later ghosted me.  I use to think it was me, but now, I realize that people\u2019s actions are a reflection of them\u2014not me.\r\n\r\nSo a few things I would suggest:\r\n\r\n1) Can you empathize?  Can you journal and write what it must feel like from your friend/lover\u2019s perspective after your feelings \u201cjust stops.\u201d  If you cannot, then talk to a psychologist, and perhaps you have a mental disorder that could be treated.\r\n\r\n2) Are you on SSRI\u2019s?  While I am not saying don\u2019t be on prescribed meds, there is a study that has shown that a SSRI tends correlate with people, who are always chasing that novel excitement feeling of a first date.  And if it is related to medication, talk to your doctor to see if anything else can be done.\r\n\r\nMost people develop feelings, as time goes on, and I wish that for you.  Good luck to you",

In the past 7-8ish months I've been out of university (going back in April woowoo) and have had about 3 jobs within that time, all of which I've quit within a week. I worked fast food and nannying.

To clarify, I CAN do these jobs, managers usually love my work, so quitting is a surprise every time.

WOW, i never knew people related\u2026ugh. im relieved but also sad.",
        "answer": "I suggest looking into Internal Family Systems therapy to help with this. Main takeaway is not to demonize any self harm thoughts but to listen to them with curiosity and compassion. You can investigate why you wanna kill yourself and see the good in that intention like maybe you\u2019re trying to save yourself from misery or permanent pain, and then from that same calm space, you can thank yourself for caring to prevent pain but state that the plan is self preservation over self harm. \r\n\r\nThe intrusive thoughts can come from not having dialogue between that calm, most current/ present version of you and those parts of you that are hurting more and carrying pain. Just trust that you can hold space to love yourself and create that internal safety in your dialogue. \r\n\r\nFrom your comments/post: \r\n\r\nPart A: fear of being suicidal; demonizing that like saying you\u2019re scared of going \u201cinsane\u201d \r\n\r\nPart B: suicidal; probably really hurting and trying to show you an escape route you clung to before learning healthier coping skills \r\n\r\nYou can speak to these parts of you and offer compassion and understanding and listen without trying to change them. Understanding the positive intent can make the thoughts less scary while also allowing you to calmly decide not to act on those thoughts- like if you understand the suicidal thought is coming from insecurity and wanting to not feel insecure, you can reason with that part of you that insecurity is not permanent, so you won\u2019t react with a permanent solution. That\u2019s just an example. \r\n\r\nSending love and healing your way. Keep it up on the asking for help part. \ud83d\udc95",

        "answer": "it's a neurological disorder that affects sensory processing, cognitive processing, and social understanding. Autistic people tend to experience senses on either extreme (nothing or too much), process and understand the world in an very different way, and often times have unique ways of understanding and expressing speech, social ques, facial expressions, tone, social Norms, etc. of course it is much more complex and nuanced but that's a very detailed response if someone just doesn't get it. if they want more depth and a more nuanced understanding, they need to do the research rather than rely on you to explain it",

        "answer": "It really depends on the concert, I love heavy music (Thrash Metal, Death Metal, Deathcore, etc.), This is what I've learned from going to concerts: Ear plugs help a ton, they also protect your hearing if it's a particularly loud concert. Most places with mosh pits have areas that are less populated so you don't have to make physical contact with anyone, keep a phone with the vibration on so you can easily keep in contact with anyone you may need to contact and ask that your group do the same, it can be easy to get separated from them so it's good to have a text based way to communicate. Be aware of the toilet situation, they're usually crowded and stink horribly. Eat before you go to the concert if you can as food May be non existent, and plan on drinking bottled water if you get thirsty, it can get hot with that many people in one place. Also, the bottled water is expensive at a concert, carry some cash.\r\n\r\nAll of this being said, I recommend going. I love live music, it feels different from listening on headphones.\r\n\r\nAre there any particular music groups that you have an interest in?

Some people like tall, some people like short, most people here believe autism is a part of who you are, and not so much as a disability.

How does everyone cope with their relationships?\r\n This picture pretty much encapsulates my feelings about this, it looks like a nice idea but has a touch of the \u2018Little Shop of Horrors\u2019 vibes going on. \r\n I\u2019ve known my wife for almost 30 years but still have trust issues. From thinking she\u2019s trying to poison me with food, plug in air fresheners (pretty sure they\u2019re carcinogenic but she loves them) to just the everyday thinking she wants to pop me off even though her actions suggest otherwise sometimes how do you handle your relationships? \r\n I left my wife 6 years ago as I couldn\u2019t cope with all the mixed feelings, yet here I am still buying her the flowers which she prefers (reminds me of the film \u2018Little Shop of Horrors\u2019), and still as mixed up as the day I met her, is this an Autism thing or am I just f\u2019d up in a different way? She\u2019s a nurse (a sister that runs a Cardiothoracic ward) so obviously fits in to society well and I can never understand why we lasted so long or why she still prefers my company even though I separated from her 6 years ago due to feeling like I was going to explode and possibly commit violence towards her at that moment.

        "answer": "Me and my spouse (both autistic) have been married for 9 years. Every autistic person is different and struggles with different issues. We do not struggle to connect the way you described your struggle. I highly suspect that the feelings you are experiencing are rooted in trauma rather than autistm. You probably don't have a healthy normal working model for how to have a trusting and loving relationship. If you want to reconnect with your ex wife I would recommend talking to a therapist to work on your attachment issues.  Furthermore, it's totally possible that you don't love and don't trust your ex wife for good reason and she's a covert narcissist who you should get away from. Only you know the answer to that. Best of luck sorting out things in your life and finding genuine and meaningful connections.",

        "question": "Love and marriage how do you all cope? How does everyone cope with their relationships?\r\n This picture pretty much encapsulates my feelings about this, it looks like a nice idea but has a touch of the \u2018Little Shop of Horrors\u2019 vibes going on. \r\n I\u2019ve known my wife for almost 30 years but still have trust issues. From thinking she\u2019s trying to poison me with food, plug in air fresheners (pretty sure they\u2019re carcinogenic but she loves them) to just the everyday thinking she wants to pop me off even though her actions suggest otherwise sometimes how do you handle your relationships? \r\n I left my wife 6 years ago as I couldn\u2019t cope with all the mixed feelings, yet here I am still buying her the flowers which she prefers (reminds me of the film \u2018Little Shop of Horrors\u2019), and still as mixed up as the day I met her, is this an Autism thing or am I just f\u2019d up in a different way? She\u2019s a nurse (a sister that runs a Cardiothoracic ward) so obviously fits in to society well and I can never understand why we lasted so long or why she still prefers my company even though I separated from her 6 years ago due to feeling like I was going to explode and possibly commit violence towards her at that moment. I pretty much left one day when she was giving me shit and got myself a flat within the week yet I still don\u2019t live alone without her support. I know it\u2019s not \u2018normal\u2019 and I guess I \u2018love\u2019 her in sofar as I understand what love is although I\u2019m not certain that emotion is \u2018real\u2019 enough for me to ever commit myself fully to another person, wholeheartedly that is.\r\n Is there something that I\u2019m missing, is this how all Autists feel or is there something else wrong\u2026and how does the average Autist get on with their relationships? \r\n I know that I give her something in her life that makes her complete, of that I have no doubt. But why do I always feel that I don\u2019t connect because of my own ideals and ideas, and how can I sync enough with \u2018reality\u2019 so that I can see her as a human being and not some other animal that I barely gaf about, how do you cope with your reality of a relationship?

        "question": "I'm suddenly conflicted about getting an official diagnosis I (25F) am self-diagnosed after doing 4 years of research about autism. I wanted to get an official diagnosis as well. I've been in the waiting list, and now got the opportunity for an appointment in February, but I am suddenly reconsidering...\r\n\r\n\r\nThe reason is mostly because of my biological mother. I am an adult (25) but I read that the parents of an autistic person can gain legal guardianship of the child, no matter the childs age and this terrifies me. I am currently stuck at my parents house, and will be for a few more months until I saved up enough money to move out.\r\n\r\n\r\nMy mother was awfully manipulative, abusive and an alcoholic. She also constantly plays the victim to get attention. Nowadays she mellowed down, but I don't trust her after everything that happened. Her waiting for me to get a diagnosis just so she can get guardianship of me - her adult child, - to get attention and play the victim is definitely something she would do. To make matters worse, she works as a caretaker for disabled people, so she definitely knows about all this stuff.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnother reason is that I likely won't get any private insurance, which sucks since I am self employed. I am in Europe, but it's still worth mentioning.\r\n\r\n\r\nShould I go to the appointment? I considered to move out first and then get a new appointment, but then I will be in the waiting list for another few years which sucks. Should I just scratch my plans of getting a diagnosis altogether? I feel really conflicted :/",

        "question": "Since the term \"Asperger's syndrome\" has fallen out of favor, is there a better term for this variety of autism? I don't know much about ASD \u2013 but it seems like the term \"Asperger's\" was useful to denote a certain part of the autism spectrum, characterized mainly by social impairment.\r\n\r\nNow that Asperger's syndrome has been removed from the DSM, and Hans Asperger's collaboration with the Nazis has been more widely acknowledged, I understand that many people prefer to avoid the term.\r\n\r\n**ETA:** I understand that Asperger's wasn't removed from the DSM *because* of the Nazi connection. I don't know where people are getting that. I was citing (1) the removal from the DSM, and (2) the Nazi connection, as two *separate and unrelated* reasons that people might prefer to avoid the term.\r\n\r\nI'm just curious: is there another term which means \"a kind of autism mainly defined by social difficulties\"? Is Asperger's the same thing as \"high-functioning autism\"?\r\n\r\nThanks.\r\n\r\n**ETA 2:** It seems that the answer to my question is \"Level 1 Autism Spectrum Disorder\". Thanks to those who answered the question.\r\n\r\n**ETA 3:** A lot of commenters have pointed out to me that \"ASD is a spectrum\". (I know this \u2013 I used the word \"spectrum\" in my very first sentence.)\r\n\r\nI think that our confusion stems from a difference in understanding of what the word \"spectrum\" *means* in this analogy. I've always understood it to mean something like \"gradient\" \u2013 with people who can live independently in an NT world at one end of the spectrum, and people who need a lot of support at the other end.\r\n\r\n(In my experience, that's absolutely how the term \"autism spectrum\" is generally understood among the general public. That's also how it's described in many general-audience resources about autism.)\r\n\r\nHowever, I'm seeing other resources which suggest that it isn't *cases of autism* that are distributed on a spectrum, but rather *symptoms* \u2013\u00a0[like this](https://carmenbpingree.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-13-at-4.30.12-PM.png). And each person with autism experiences a different subset of those symptoms. According to this interpretation, the \"spectrum\" has nothing to do with low support needs vs. high support needs.\r\n\r\nThat's actually a more sensible analogy for the word \"spectrum\" \u2013 but, again, it's contrary to the \"gradient\" analogy that I've always heard in the past. And given that many medical resources \u2013 and even people *in this thread* \u2013 endorse the \"gradient\" interpretation, it seems fair to ask: who gets to declare which interpretation is the \"correct\" one?\r\n\r\nI'm glad to have gained a better understanding of this, but I do wish someone had just politely said \"people often use the word 'spectrum' to mean 'gradient of support needs', but some people use it to mean 'variety of possible symptoms'\".\r\n\r\n**ETA 4:** And now that I've looked further into it, I'm finding *still other* interpretations of the \"spectrum\" model (being offered by autistic folks). A lot of people seem to be *really confident* that they have the One True Interpretation of the term \"autism spectrum\", and that other interpretations are Wrong. I guess that's just the internet for you.",

Am I asking the right group?",
        "answer": "For my work, I help people with autism improve their communication, and this is a fairly common happenstance I encounter. \r\n\r\nMy supposition is that, from a communication standpoint, fictional people can paradoxically seem more \"real\" due to the written medium being much easier to interpret because the details are all there in black and white. The reader is provided details by an omniscient third person narrator that specifically describes the characters mental functions and states. So one can be told both the actions and motivations of characters in a way that is never available and always significantly harder to interpret in real life. First person narratives can be even better at providing this information directly to the reader, eliminating the potential for communication breakdowns that generally cause difficulty in the lives of many people with autism. \r\n\r\nThe imagining of mental scenarios involving the fictional person then becomes both easier to imagine, since one is explicitly told their mental states and the particulars of their problems, as well as more satisfying because one can imagine being helpful in a way they struggle to be in day to day life. There is absolutely nothing wrong with such fantasies and imaginings, because ideally they can become the basis for real life interactions. \r\n\r\nJust keep in mind the reasons why you are finding a world with all the blanks and motivations filled in more enjoyable.",

Everyone has been encouraging me to do a vaginal delivery and talking about how I definitely do not want a C section unless it's medically necessary. I feel like it IS necessary but no one else seems to understand why I think it's the better way to do this. I have bad sensory issues, plus a heart condition and get severe chest pain when I'm stressed which has been happening every time I get contractions even though I'm already on medication for my heart.

I can't deal with what I've been going through already, it's beyond uncomfortable. I haven't slept more than an hour or two a night for the past week because of the pain and anxiety and I feel so awful by now. There's NO WAY I'll be in a place to mentally handle 24+ hrs of labor.

Feelings, sarcasm, cues, everything comes as easily to me as it does for a neurotypical person. This is something I never heard of on an autistic person. \r\n\r\nThe autism symptoms I have that I believe convinced the neuropsychologist that I'm autistic are: \r\n\r\n\u2022 I have especial interests (often it's hard to think of something else tbh)\r\n\u2022 I can't do something different without being warned about it days before\r\n\u2022 I feel uncomfortable when something that is usually in one place is now on another place (the Twitter updates make me want to punch Elon Musk bc of it, btw)\r\n\u2022 I feel uncomfortable if I have to eat on a plate that isn't the one I'm used to (depending on the plate, I rather have the work of putting the food on another one and washing the first plate than eat on it)\r\n\u2022 I have very mild sensory issues\r\n\u2022 I self-soothe through repetitive behaviours\r\n\u2022 I stim a lot (both for coping and bc of happiness)\r\n\u2022 I have no impulse control (which results in some random compulsions, like clicking on every \"show replies\" button on the Twitter threads I open even though I have no intention of reading those replies) \r\n\u2022 I feel overwhelmed with social interactions quickly, and need to isolate myself to walk in circles for a bit \r\n\u2022 I have (very bad) executive disfunction\r\n\u2022 I can't switch tasks without preparing myself for a while \r\n\r\nAlso I don't know if this is an autism thing but I can't pretend to feel something I'm not feeling nor can I act in a way I wouldn't act naturally (like being formal), not because of morals, but because it feels like lying and that feels very, very uncomfortable even if I know it isn't hurting anyone and sometimes even benefiting people. \r\n\r\n(Of course I also have symptoms that are due to ADHD only, but I won't list them bc I know I have ADHD) \r\n\r\nEvery symptom besides the first 4 are also ADHD symptoms, and maybe it's not that I have special interests, but that it is hard to find something that interests me so I focus a lot on the things that do (I feel like I am reaching about the special interests. I feel like I'm lying. It is actually making me uncomfortable. But it is a theory, either I actually believe in it or not.) \r\n\r\nDoes this sound like autism to you??\r\n(I'm a 23yo woman if that makes any difference)",

TW: Eating issues\r\n\r\nCan someone help me understand why it's \"bad\" to eat more than one hot meal a day?\r\n\r\nMy mother, throughout my life (im 27 now), has never let me have more than one hot meal a day because its \"bad for you\" \r\nEven to the point where I won't have anything to eat because there is only cookable or fast food available\r\n\r\nI know I'm an adult and I can cook my own food but she will either constantly goad me about how bad it is if I do eat a second hot meal or if we've gone out for the day they won't stop anywhere for me to buy food for dinner because I'd have already had a 'hot meal' at lunch time (today I had chippy chips) \r\n\r\nI have eating issues, if I don't eat after a certian amount of time, when I'm hungry, I completely give up on food and won't eat, ranging from hours to days - she knows this \r\n\r\nI just don't understand this rule of only being able to have one hot meal a day? Why is it a rule and who made it a rule!?\r\n\r\nEdit: I've put some extra notes in the comments~\r\nEdit 2: Links \r\n[Note 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/autism/comments/1133iwn/eating_a_hot_meal_more_than_once_rule/j8nsd2w?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share&context=3)\r\n[Note 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/autism/comments/1133iwn/eating_a_hot_meal_more_than_once_rule/j8qqsjq?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share&context=3)",

But inside their soul they feel a massive burden. So with them, most people that look at them don't even notice there's a problem. For me the term high-functioning means unnoticeable by their friends and family. Etc.\r\n\r\nLEVEL 4\r\n\r\nThen there's the fully blown \"This is who I am now\" addict. The \"anything\" has now become the most important thing in their life and they will protect it regardless of whatever it hurts around them. It requires an impressive amount of effort as well. This is when the manipulation of friends, or stealing shit from people they love, and high risk situations, are no longer an issue as long as they get that \"anything\".\r\n\r\nHope that helps!",

They only happen at night, and while it takes a while, I can usually calm down from them. A few weeks ago, I had a bad one. I had a cold, and tried to take a bunch of cold medicine in the middle of the night to fall asleep. It just made me really high, and afraid i would die. That was the first time i ever woke my mom up when i was having one. 3 days ago, monday, i was in class at 10:15. I had just taken 2 ibuprofen, when suddenly I remembered the cold medicine incident, and started having a panic attack. I had to call my mom to come get me, and she brought me home. Since that, I've been going in and out of panic attacks. Three whole days. It's felt like weeks. Its the worst in the morning, then throughout the day it goes in and out, and then is bad again before bed. In morning and night, I usually get an actual panic attack (dread feelings, shaking, unable to breathe) and i cant eat anything, but after i do i sometimes feel better. And throughout the day when im not having shaking or severe flushes of the dread, panic feeling, I have a lingering feeling of it that never goes away, and i still cant breathe deeply. I havent gone back to school because im always really bad in the morning, and when i try to go back during the day, im just to scared. We went to a doctor yesterday, but they didnt do anything. Im going to my therapist tomorrow. I want to go to school. I dont want my parents to be disappointed. Both tuesday and this morning, I swear i was really trying to go to school, but i was just too afraid. Im constantly on the verge of a panic attack or crying, and it never stops.

Very dangerous area eventually knocking stopped I waited about 5 mins and I grabbed a screw driver and I went to my bedroom which is near the door to look outside It\u2019s pitch black but I see a guy his wearing one of those orange work shirts that are reflective that is how I see him but can\u2019t make out his face or anything but he is waving a ton at me. I am scared and he could see the screw driver in my hand in the window I feel like now I\u2019ve been seen I need to open the door and see what\u2019s going on. I open it the guy says nothing and starts coming up to me on the steps still pitch black can\u2019t see him. I don\u2019t move but am holding my screw driver. And then He says hi and I recognise his voice it\u2019s my neighbour who lives downstairs. And I\u2019m like hi?

And then he just starts talking about the landlord and how he doesn\u2019t like him and how he thinks our house is flooding and other random stuff like some houses he has seen that looks like ours and just going into random detail like about our staircase and stuff and saying he thinks he might get a plumber so asked what day would be good for me and then asked me for my number and I don\u2019t know it from memory so we agreeed to share our numbers later.

        "question": "when is self diagnosing okay? *please read full story first* okay so im younger to say the least; early teenager. it has been pretty clear i have had a mental problem since i was 8. my parents used to take me to therapy, but even that took a lot of convincing. they told me i just had simple anxiety and stress and everyone had it. they made it very clear to me that i wasn\u2019t special or anything and that nothing was wrong. they pulled me out of therapy a few years ago when they claimed that i was fine. they aren\u2019t the most supportive and don\u2019t believe in mental health issues. they constantly laugh, mock, and insult people who have problems like that. i went on for a long time thinking i just had general anxiety disorder, which is just having more anxiety than most people. recently though, i\u2019ve been getting worse. after weeks of research, i\u2019m pretty sure i have bpd. i match all the symptoms for impulsive, petulant, and discouraged/quiet bpd. i know that is a big assumption. doctors don\u2019t like to make it and it\u2019s usually a last resort type of thing (or at least that\u2019s what i\u2019ve seen). i\u2019ve also researched all the disorders that have overlapping symptoms with bpd, but they don\u2019t fit me. it\u2019s either my symptoms are completely different, or i match the symptoms but there is way more to it. bpd just fit perfectly and i was satisfied until i saw people saying self diagnosing isn\u2019t valid at all. i\u2019ve done all my research, but i know i could never get an actual diagnosis because of my parents. i just really want a label so i can better learn how to help myself. i want to be able to comprehend what is happening in my head instead of just thinking i\u2019m crazy. i also don\u2019t want to offend people by being self diagnosed. people are afraid of self diagnosed people giving bpd a bad reputation and i don\u2019t want to do that. i don\u2019t think i would, but i don\u2019t want people to be angry. is self diagnosing okay in my situation? thanks so much",

This is especially difficult right now with the Hogwarts Legacy release and the fact that I'm trans. Is anyone else having conflicting feelings like this?",
        "answer": "TLDR: Separate the art and the artist if you can, and keep any joy you can in life :) But if you can't do that, that's okay too. You deserve for your interests to be simple and good, and good for you.\r\n\r\nPlease, please feel free to ignore this post, if what you need from us is just some help to let you make peace with still loving HP. You can. That's okay. It's valid! But if you're not able to do that... Just for a contrast to the comments you already have... I can see why. I abandoned a special interest that had soured, and it was really difficult. At the time, I really needed to find other people talking about that. And I couldn't. So *just in case* that's where you are, here's an essay about it for you :) If you're not there, just don't read it :)\r\n\r\nI think some people can separate the artists from the art, and that's great for them. In a similar way, some people can view media as a product of its time, and so accept the level of casual racism, sexism, transphobia and so on that was socially acceptable at the time a show was made, or a book was written. If you can do that, genuinely no judgement - that's great for you, and it makes life much easier.\r\n\r\nBut, I feel like if you made this post, maybe you can't easily do that? I can't either. I have too much autistic hyper-morality, and I'm too black and white about it, and I can't think about a thing without considering the wider context it's situated in, and all the connotations of that, and all the implications of it. I can't support HP because I can't in any way legitimise JK or anything she stands for. I will never give my money, even as a click or a stream, to something that comes from someone I'm ideologically opposed to. That's my brain and how it works, and a lot of the time that's great. But it does mean I can't separate the art from the artist, so I can't engage with anything when I'm unable to forget it's problematic in these kinds of ways. \r\n\r\n...And the thing is, if the special interest is now inextricably linked to that kind of a conflict for you, it itself becomes a source of misery. Everyone says to separate the two, but being trans usually comes with societal trauma, and she's in the media making things worse - so it is genuinely triggering. If every time you try to engage with the HP world, you think of JK Rowling, her terf views, and her particular, insidious attacks on autistic AFAB people... Then you are actually retraumatising yourself, by trying to hold on to something that's become poison. Because it should be your safe place. And your coping strategy. And where you get to lose yourself. But instead it's an attack on everything you are. It's an attack once removed, because JK is the issue, not HP itself... But for some of us, engaging at all makes you feel complicit. And there's trauma enough for us in the world, without opening yourself up and letting it in.\r\n\r\nIf you can separate the two and make peace with it, good for you, go for it. But if it's causing you more pain than it's worth, you're allowed to walk away. Losing a special interest is awful, and it hurts for a long time, and sometimes for years. But if you want to go down that route... That's okay. It's not overreacting, because she's made it very clear that everything she stands for is an attack on what makes you you. She doesn't deserve you, and you deserve a special interest that makes you happy. Simply, uncomplicatedly happy. Trans joy is real; autistic joy is real. You deserve it.

I have GAD and a phobia of vomiting, and we were in a beer tent. I was overwhelmed and asked to leave, so my BF came back to the tent with me and we missed the rest of the night. As soon as we left the field, I started to feel like I was being manipulative and lying about my anxiety. \r\n\r\nAnother example is when I needed to minute a very important meeting at work. The first few times I minuted this meeting, I was not able to sleep for at least a week prior and felt so much anxiety during the meeting that I dissociated and couldn't keep up with what was happening. I explained how I felt to my boss and she offered to come with me so I wasn't alone and the pressure was off. As soon as I agreed to her coming along with me, my brain was like \"there you go, getting what you want again\".\r\n\r\nRationally, I know that in both of these situations I was anxious and that I never forced anyone to do anything. It's just so difficult to shut my anxiety up.\r\n\r\nDoes anyone else ever get this?",

        "question": "Does anyone else get anxious when they hear any type of yelling? Before I start, I want to mention that I have not been diagnosed with anxiety so far, but this is the only community where I feel like I can let this out and ask this question. (Also im new to Reddit and don\u2019t know how exactly this works, so if I do anything wrong please let me know) \r\n\r\nSo I\u2019m currently 18 years old and as for my childhood I\u2019d say it was okay. I was a pretty shy and \u2018good\u2019 kid so never got into trouble much. That\u2019s also why I can\u2019t recall ever being yelled at or hit. Maybe once, but my parent did apologise and state what they did wasn\u2019t okay so I don\u2019t think that would have affected me.\r\n\r\nHowever, I get so anxious when I hear anybody yell. It doesn\u2019t even have to be directed at me. A few examples: one of my teachers has a pretty strong, loud voice. When he suddenly calls out a student\u2019s name while I\u2019m doing my homework, I pretty much flinch even though his tone isn\u2019t even angry. \r\n\r\nOr a few weeks ago when a classmate wasn\u2019t wearing a mask, a teacher followed them into our classroom and basically yelled at them for at least a minute. While this was going on, I forced myself to just look down at my notebook and focus on anything but the yelling. Though I tried to distract myself, my eyes were teary and I felt a lump in my throat and I was really tense for the rest of that class. I think that was the most anxious I had felt in years. \r\n\r\nMy sibling who is 12 can be described as a \u2018troublemaker\u2019 I guess. They\u2019re the opposite of me which can be good at times, but it sometimes gets on my parents\u2019 nerves. They don\u2019t listen, aren\u2019t okay with being told \u201cno\u201d and pretty much do what they want when they feel like it. Because of this I often hear my parents being upset at them and I\u2019ve heard my parent yell at them a lot. Sometimes I\u2019d be in the same room, other times I\u2019d be in my room and they\u2019d be downstairs. During these times I\u2019ll also get very tense and just have a horrible feeling. If I\u2019m in the same room I won\u2019t even say a word and just get up and leave because it\u2019s too much. \r\n\r\nI have no idea what to do with this. I have an intake at a therapist next week for some mental health related issues, should I bring this up too? And does this happen to anyone else? I really don\u2019t understand why this happens to me \r\n\r\nThank you in advance for the help :)",
        "answer": "I absolutely HATE yelling. Like really, really bad. I\u2019m no sigmund freud but for me it\u2019s definitely because I grew up in an incredibly shaky household. My family was always fighting, police coming in and out of my house, just overall not fun stuff. So I\u2019m assuming that has something to do with it for me. Definitely bring this up with your therapist, perhaps they will be able to help that initial trigger, but regardless bringing up any trigger is only going to help you and your therapist work on a treatment plan. If this is your first appointment, try and spend a few minutes and just jot down the things, the moments, and the people that make you anxious. It\u2019s only going to help.

I get this with watching shows and reading books I haven\u2019t before, or even doing crafts.

Does anyone else have this issue or is it just me??\r\n\r\nEdit: thank you everyone for responding below - I honestly really felt like I was the only one in the world who felt this way. Thank you for helping me feel like I\u2019m not alone in this!",
        "answer": "Definitely! I find a lot of really small things incredibly daunting - humans have a way of wanting to remain idle and fight against change. Even if that change is a new book or tv show. \r\n\r\nIt often happens because it almost feels like work. You might feel guilty for going on Reddit, or watching the same old TV. So you project this new experience as something you *should* do and your usual habits as something you *shouldn\u2019t*. \r\n\r\nTry and reframe your thinking and tell yourself that it\u2019s OK to go on Reddit - but it\u2019s also OK if you don\u2019t want to. And it\u2019s OK to not want to read a new book, but it also could be really fulfilling (as it often is). Once you train this muscle by actually following through with new activities, it\u2019ll become like second nature. Sometimes you might \u201cfall off the wagon\u201d and return to routine, but that\u2019s perfectly ok! It\u2019s only natural. What\u2019s important is understanding that once you want to leave that routine, you\u2019re fully capable at any time. \r\n\r\nCheers :)",

I went through a really stressful event a few months ago which made my anxiety skyrocket. I have been suffering from chest pains that come and go but sometimes can last all day. It feels like a deep pain or intense burning on the left side of my chest. I\u2019ve been to numerous doctors appointments and have had ECGs, a heart echo, CBC blood test, and comprehensive metabolic panel. The doctor told me there was nothing wrong with my heart and that she would be shocked if a healthy 28 year old was having a heart attack. I am still convinced that somehow the doctor missed something. When I\u2019m in the midst of intense chest pain, it\u2019s hard to not want to go to the ER, but I can\u2019t afford to go to the ER every time the chest pain happens since it\u2019s so frequent. I would probably be there once a week.\r\n\r\nI\u2019m at a point where I\u2019m constantly anxious due to the chest pain which then is probably making the chest pain worse.

        "answer": "It seems you have an anxious attachment style. Attachment types are formed in childhood and directly impact how you interact in relationships.

Feeling anxious when my partner wasn\u2019t around, checking my phone if he texted. The root of it is usually subconscious fear of loss. I felt like I wanted to break up with my partner too because it was so overwhelming. I started therapy and this is where I learnt about my anxious attachment style. If you have the resources available, I would definitely recommend therapy. It really helped my process my relationship anxiety and separation anxiety. If you don\u2019t have the resources available, simply google it and learn some tips on steps you can take to slowly become more secure. \r\n\r\nYou are worthy of the love you are receiving from him!!! You say he is great, sweet, romantic and well mannered. That is amazing!!! I know it feels scary when he leaves but remember he is totally into you! I learnt about things I can ask from my partner that helped ease the separation anxiety. Such as checking in, or simple reassurance went a long way. \r\n\r\nAgain, there is nothing wrong with you and you are not a bad person. Your attachment is simply activated. Once you have awareness, it helps because you can understand what is happening and why. \r\n\r\nWishing you lots of luck!! You got this!",

I was there for one week and I live in Hungary so I have limited experience and knowledge about what you're might be getting into but here's what I know nonetheless. I hope it helps. \r\n\r\nFirst of all I was already going to therapy and had a developing support system that I was taken out of. You on the other hand don't seem to have a stable support system at all and would probably benefit from the attention of professionals and people with similar issues (aka you could even make some friends although in my experience it is a hit or miss. But you will definitely benefit from hearing similar stories from people in similar but just different enough situations, trust me). ***If you feel like you need help you're probably right.*** Getting away from your parents, whatever the exact situation might be would also seem like a good idea based on what you wrote. ***In sum I definitely recommend talking to a therapist and it might even be beneficial for you to go to hospital*** although that depends on the hospital itself. Also you should definitely ask your therapist about being hospitalised, especially if you're afraid to be open because of the uncertainties surrounding it. They will have better answers suited for you than any of us here on reddit. \r\n\r\nI'm not sure about your local place's rules but in my experience and what I heard in other places as well they take your phone away. We had one hour daily to use our phones, which overlapped with the one hour that visitors were allowed so I practically couldn't use it at all because parents always bugged me to pay attention to them lol. Entertainment wise they provided a lot of things, from art supplies through TV to guided activities and even played with us if none of the other patients were willing so I didn't miss social media but I did miss being able to communicate with my friends.\r\n\r\nIf you get put in a hospital ***your legal guardian will know about it.*** I'm not sure if you can prevent them from visiting you as I never had an issue like that but you should talk about a doctor with it. I'm sure you're not the first one who would have an issue like that (if you even want to prevent them. That's just the vibe I got from your post). ***They will also most likely see the reports that the doctors write about you***, which can be very scary, I know. In my experience it doesn't contain very specific things, just general statements. For me these reports (or at least the parts in laymans terms) were 3-4 short paragraphs long where at least one would be taken up by my background (how old I was, what my hobbies were, where I went to school, etc). This was in every report, I assume, for the purpose of informing any other doctor or therapist that might take my case about the basic info needed about me. A report like this was produced after every one-on-one talk, sometimes including psychological tests. The 2nd-3rd paragraphs were taken up by the contents of these talks and tests, again, general tastements, almost bulletpoints about the most important things. The last paragraph would talk about diagnoses, suspected and outruled problems. ***So don't be scared because of this. Having your parents know about stuff is a necessary sacrifice for the betterment of yourself.*** This is also something I had to come to terms with and was very uncomfortable at first. But you have to understand that this is a \"necessary evil\" for things to get better.\r\n\r\n***GOING TO HOSPITAL  WILL NOT RUIN YOUR LIFE*** */in most cases\r\nUnless you get sent to a *very* bad mental hospital that worsens your condition, you will not really lose from this. For the duration of your stay there you will probably not go to school, unless they let you go online, however a lot of the time it's an important point to let people there take a rest from school or work. If that means missing an exam based on how severe your situation is they might just say that you'll have to take it next year. But trust me, they know what they're doing. If they say you need to miss the exam, you're probably better off missing that exam >!than killing yourself over it if you get what I'm saying!<\r\n\r\nRecord of you being there will of course be in your medical records and your GP will probably know about it. I think there are aa few diagnoses and medicines that would prevent you from driving a car for example or if you are very violent they might prevent you from becoming a teacher and prohibit you from getting a firearm. But these are ***extreme cases*** and >!unless you killed or raped someone!< getting a diagnoses will not have any serious negative effects. On the contrary it will greatly help you, your caregivers and your doctors in understanding your problem and its possible solutions so don't shy away from it. \r\n\r\nAlso, I'm not a lawyer but to my knowledge you have zero obligation to disclose your medical history to your regular ol' job provider unless it's relevant to the actual work. If anything this will only help you with overcoming your issues and being more balanced in the future - aka having a better life. ***I can't stress this enough. If you feel like you need help, get help! It will most likely actually help!***\r\n\r\nThroughout this comment I talked about ***inpatient treatment*** aka: you sleep there, eat there, shower there and can't leave unless they let you. Based on your specific circumstances you might be put in ***outpatient care.*** We had one outpatient girl who slept and showered at home. However from ~8-16 (I don't remember the exact time but for the majority of the day) she was mandated to be there in the hospital and follow the same rules as us aka: not leave without supervision unless allowed and follow the activities of the group. She ate with us, etc. but would go home at the end of the day. Whether you go inpatient or outpatient is based on some factors: First and foremost how much of a threat are you to yourself and/or others and how safe are you at home? If you are eligible for both inpatient and outpatient and the hospital has the capacity (aka: enough beds, food, caretakers, etc) they might let you choose what you prefer. After they let me out they said they'd welcome me if I wanted to continue this in outpatient care.\r\n\r\nLast addendum: I saw a lot of people comment bad things about mental health care in the states. I have no experience with that and hearing about the absolute state of american health care saddens me greatly. I might be a bit too optimistic because I had - regardless of some traumas - actual positive experiences with therapists and the hospital I was in. But that's Hungary. Please, ***please*** ask a local professional - either a therapist or your GP - about your situation before getting into all of this! I'm not even sure if you're in the states - regardless, ***ask someone local about this who know their stuff!!! ***\r\n\r\nI hope at least you get some idea about mental hospitals from this! And I really wish for your situation to get better <3 if you have any questions you can also just message me if you'd like, I'll answer everything I can(although I might not be the most experienced) I remember how scary it was not knowing anything that went on.",

        "answer": "Statistics from the UK's Nat. Inst. for Clinical Evidence: although this is not as effective as seeing a therapist, many people suffering from anxiety benefit from self-help. In recent years, evidence for therapeutic breathing has been very encouraging.\r  \r\n\r  \r\nThe self-help I'm describing here is not complicated.  \r  \r\n\r  \r\nWhen we have a lot of anxiety, it puts worrisome thoughts into our heads. There's two ways to get rid of those thoughts.\r  \r\n \r  \r\nOne is just to calm down. The easiest way to do this is to breathe slowly till you feel OK. Two psychiatrists, Brown and Gerbarg, say a 10 or 20 min slow breathing exercise is good and 20 min twice a day is a therapy for anxiety. The exercise is inhale and exhale gently, 6 seconds each.\r  \r\n\r  \r\nWhen you're calm, you can think your way through a problem instead of just worrying about it. Think about the worst thing that can happen, how likely that is and what you could do if it happens. In a stressful situation, think about the different ways you can respond and decide which one is the most intelligent.\r  \r\n \r  \r\nDon't make mountains out of molehills.\r  \r\n \r  \r\nWhen you use the thinking brain, you get control of the emotional brain, and you feel better.\r  \r\n \r  \r\nAlso, replace negative thoughts with positive thoughts. Count your blessings and remind yourself of your successes.\r  \r\n\r  \r\nThe treatments for anxiety range from simple stress reduction methods to therapy and medication.\r  \r\n\r  \r\nDon't overlook stress management - it can help even with very bad anxiety.\r  \r\n \r  \r\nVideo - a lot of helpful information, including the 3-part program of Brown and Gerbarg -\r  \r\n\r  \r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqEM\\_jlDRZI\r  \r\n\r  \r\n  Freedom from Self-Harm: Overcoming Self-Injury with Skills from DBT and Other Treatments \r  \r\n\r  \r\nThis book has been endorsed by Marsha Linehan, who created DBT, the best treatment for borderline personality disorder, which has serious self-injury as a frequent symptom. \r  \r\n\r  \r\nThere's a wide variety of treatments. Very severe cases require months of intense therapy but many people do well with a treatment that's just a booklet and a few therapy sessions, usually 2 or 3. \r  \r\n\r  \r\nTreatments that only reduce self-harm are considered successful. The less you self-harm the stronger you are and better able to deal with the problems that led to your self-harm.  Likewise, the better you are in dealing with the underlying problems the more it reduces the self-harm.",

        "question": "How to overcome depression without therapy? I\u2019m a 20 yr old college student. Currently going through depression. On a scale of 1-10 with 10 being the worst, i\u2019d say it\u2019s a 7. The causes are loneliness (attachment issues), fear of rejection, and lack of confidence (voice, short attention span, lack of discipline, feeling behind for my age). I don\u2019t have many friends. I enjoy doing things like blogging, hanging out with people, discussing controversial topics, working out, and watching movies. however, i don\u2019t do these things often because depression makes me lazy. the only thing ive been doing consistently is going to the gym (2-3 times a week). it feels nice but doesn\u2019t help with depression. \r\n\r\ni know i\u2019m capable of so much but i\u2019m also really hard on myself whenever i mess up. i care so much about what other people think of me. \r\n\r\nSometimes, i don\u2019t feel depressed, especially when talking to family or friends, but that\u2019s probably because i\u2019m suppressing it. When i\u2019m alone or mess up in front of people or unintentionally do something to hurt someone (especially the person i\u2019m attached to), i feel it again. \r\n\r\nI\u2019d like to know how to overcome depression without going to a therapist? i WANT to do therapy but my parents don\u2019t believe it works. they told me to talk to them about depression but i have a hard time opening up. it\u2019s easier for me to open up with friends but i don\u2019t know, i don\u2019t want to be a burden. i don\u2019t want them to carry the weight of MY problems. also, talking to someone only feels good for a brief moment. once those negative thoughts and feelings resurface, i fall back into depression. it\u2019s really hard to change, it requires a shift in mindset and a shit ton of effort. I understand that it\u2019s a gradual process. \r\n\r\nSo just in case i fail at convincing my parents, i\u2019d like to know how to overcome it on my own. I heard shadow work helps with healing from trauma. What else should I do?",

        "question": "How do you guys deal with too many things happening at once? I (35 m) live in Brazil, and if you saw the news that already says something about my mental health.\r\n\r\nI lost my job at the start of covid - was temporary. After a few months looking in vain for a new job, as no one was hiring, I decided to study again. Started learning Python, applied to public university, which is free, for a second graduation and was approved. I'm currently enrolled in an IT course in uni.\r\n\r\nI also started streaming to try a little income. It's a great experience and I love doing it, but it is very tiring.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile my wife was getting her salary and paying our bills, but this year she's been cut from her research until April, which means she'll only get paid in May. That never happened before and is the result of the incompetent and malicious administration of the former government.\r\n\r\nI do have a few freelance things I'm working on, in Python, but not enough to sustain us. But we also have some money in reserve, so it will be harsh but if everything goes ok, we'll survive.\r\n\r\nI'm still looking for a job, but now I have do dedicate a lot of time to uni and to learning.\r\n\r\nAlso I have a health problem that makes me sick in semi random intervals of time, around one or two times a month. When that happens, I may or may not start throwing up. That destroyed my confidence to look for presencial work, I'm focusing on remote job hunting because there's no way to know when I'll not be feeling well.\r\n\r\nThis health problem should have been treated already, but due to bureaucracy and some management errors, my treatment stopped. I'm in a queue to go through surgery, which should solve the problem, but now I can just wait. I'm thinking about restarting treatment, going to another doctor and all that, but the money we have is precious little for our necessities.\r\n\r\nAnd I'm afraid of the surgery. A relative of my wife went through the same surgery, for the same problem, and died in ic a few days later.\r\n\r\nI'm doing therapy, my therapist gives me huge discounts to guarantee I'll keep seeing her. She's focusing in traumas I have regarding my parents. They are still alive, they are narcissists and they abused me, verbally, mentally and in some cases sexually, when I was a kid.\r\n\r\nI also have depression since I was 12.\r\n\r\nMy father in law has been diagnosed with cancer in December. My in laws are the people who basically pay our rent, so we have a place to live and can keep studying.\r\n\r\nI think all I can really do is focus in doing my things, study and take care of myself to hope and try to aquire some financial stability. But I'm having problems organizing a routine. There's too much in my head. Some days I just want to be in bed and pretend nothing exists.\r\n\r\nI'll not enter in details about depression right now, but yeah.\r\n\r\nSo, how do you deal with too much on your head? Someone has some tips about how to better organize, or anything?\r\n\r\nThanks",
        "answer": "The first step to getting organized is to take a look at what you can realistically do anything about and only invest time and thought to those . That will narrow the list down ,then look at the long game for the things you are able to work on and figure out what the first few steps are and only focus on them , when you have the first step done take a quick look at the long game again and move into step two.You cannot control everything and you cannot start in the middle so there is no point in stressing over those parts .",

So me and my therapist agreed on and found out that I have autistic traits and I am autistic, but due to my score on the tests (1 point below the diagnosis points) she won't give me the diagnosis on paper.\r\n\r\nHence why the question and curiosity. In which category do I fall? 'Self-diagnosed' or 'Official diagnosed'?\r\n\r\nBTW I did check the criteria's and did some research regarding autism and I do relate to a good amount of them.

I did the tests multiple times.\r\n* I researched how autism presents itself in woman and I related to them.\r\n* This all happened during the course of 2-4 months.\r\n* I did not do a full assessments regarding whether or not I have autism, the two online tests that I took sent to me from my therapist. Had more tests regarding other stuff.\r\n* I do see certain behaviors I exhibited when I was child to how it might come forward with autism. This was from a psych book that is trust-worthy.\r\n*  My end goal with this post was not to determine or talk publicly saying I am autistic (cause of fear that maybe I am spreading misinformation).

        "question": "Mom of teen seeking insight into my child\u2019s symptoms Concerned mom of teen - looking to learn from experiences of others\r\n\r\nI am a mom, and my oldest daughter is 17, nearly 18. She is a wonderful young person and the light of my life. For the last few years, she has been struggling openly with anxiety and depression. I have taken her to a few psychiatrists and she also sees a talk therapist regularly. She\u2019s been so far on only a few different SSRIs and is now on Zoloft, which seems to be working just a little bit better for her than other meds. Over the past year, her mental health has gotten even worse though and she\u2019s been quite vocal to me about her feelings of helplessness and wanting to get better. I am trying to do everything I can to figure out exactly how to help. She has a lot of signs that she believes may be autism. We do have lots of autistic people in our family, so this isn\u2019t a wild idea. She didn\u2019t have any of the typical early childhood symptoms though, but due to her own social media research, she thinks she may be autistic because if her feelings of burnout, need to stim for self soothing, dislike of certain textures and sounds, etc. I am open to this possibility but want to make sure we investigate all possibilities.\r\n\r\nWhat my concern is, is that she may actually be showing signs of early schizophrenia. If this is the case, I would like to get the right interventions in place before a major episode of psychosis potentially causes big problems for her. Here is why I am questioning whether this could be the case: 1) she says she sometimes hallucinates flies, as in she sees flies that she later realizes are not real. 2) Her mental health symptoms get worse at night. 3) She has lots of intrusive thoughts that really upset her, such as thoughts of grisly violent things, harm happening to people she cares about, imagining her beloved cat is dead, etc. I know she must have lots of disturbing intrusive thoughts about herself doing bad things, because she cries a lot that she is a bad person. 4) she admitted she did a very large amount of psilocybin mushrooms at one time (first time user and didn\u2019t know she was using too much) last year and said she had lots of hallucinations when she did it, and that she still gets vivid flashbacks of this. 5) she has paranoid thoughts and fears sometimes about things like there being people in the walls or attic. 6) she gets really upset about things sometimes if she makes a mistake like spilling a bowl of food and then she hits herself and talks about self harm. \r\n\r\nI am not sure if these might be early signs of schizophrenia or not. I have tried to do research and read some people say that hallucinations of insects were their first signs. I don\u2019t know how long it takes to go from that to big breaks in reality though. Can anyone share your experiences with me? I just want to help her but am not sure how. I am NOT expecting or asking for anyone to attempt to offer a diagnosis, obviously. What I am interested in is hearing from people with schizophrenia as to what your first symptoms were and how long did it take from those to first episode of psychosis? Also, if anyone with a diagnosis other than schizophrenia has had these same types of symptoms, what is your diagnosis? I am still working on finding the right professionals to take these things seriously and I would like to do my own research to take to the professionals as well and just to be more enlightened as to what might be going on.

        "question": "How to not become prejudiced after being abused? Hi at first I\u2019ll admit that I\u2019m writing this post after seeing something triggered my trauma very hard. \r\n\r\nSo to begin with a about two years ago I survived a 3 years long cycle of being both mentally and sexually abused by my girlfriend who was supported in the entire thing by her family (entirely female), also a lot of this came to be with them weaponising toxic patriarchal standards and stereotypes. This entire thing really badly skewed my view of women. \r\n\r\nAs someone who was always big on not generalising people and viewing everyone as an individual I somewhat overcame it in day to day basis to the point that I have no problem with the fact that most of my friends are female. \r\n\r\nBut still as a rather progressive left-leaning person I often visit internet spaces which are also frequently feminist spaces. And giving examples from Reddit (I won\u2019t give the exact subs names) I\u2019ve seen a lot of discussions about male abuse, mental health and effects of toxic masculinity on them. And unfortunately I\u2019ve seen a lot of women commenting (and being highly upvoted) things like \u201cthose problems are caused mostly by other men\u201d \u201cwomen are still most affected\u201d \u201cit\u2019s not our job to do anything about it\u201d today I even saw a comment (with 100+ upvotes) about how a man can\u2019t even be raped, and causes of man being SA by a woman are so rare that they aren\u2019t even worth taking care about. \r\n\r\nAnd I\u2019ll admit that seeing things like that triggers something in me and al that calm logical non-generalising thinking about which I talked about and which allows me to normally and friendly interact with women gets thrown out the window, and In filled with I m not sure how to exactly describe it but with some kind of mix of anger and extreme fear and resentment, feeling that that\u2019s how everyone views my experience and that what was done to me is somehow excusable or viewed as unimportant by most women. \r\n\r\nI\u2019m sorry if what I\u2019m writing is a bit of an incoherent rambling but I\u2019m not in a really good place right now\r\n\r\nI wanted to ask if anyone experienced similar feelings/issues with any group of people (not exactly women) caused by their trauma, and if you did, how do you dealt with it?",
        "answer": "Yes I have experienced exactly that and have even been banned from the lgbtq+ community for talking about my rape story publicly and one of the mods found it offensive because \"men can't be raped\". I don't understand the world view of a person like that or what kind of mental gymnastics you must undergo to find yourself in that level of self-brainwashing. I also was banned on the LGBT community for asking a simple question that wasn't offensive but I won't get into any of that because of how unrelated it is. However still I feel the need to mention it because of just how volatile that community can be when it all seems like they just want to stroke their offended ego instead of having actual conversations that are productive.\r\n\r\nHonestly the only way to deal with it is to advocate for yourself even when you experience backlash and to learn how to grow a thicker skin as harsh as that sounds but that is what I have found I must do in order to change anything. I know that sounds harsh to say but it is the lesson I learned because people on the internet are not going to be nice to you and if you want to survive it you must learn how to not let it get so far under your skin. It unfortunately will always affect you or at least it still does for me, maybe one day that will change. I really don't know if it will change but all I know is staying quiet is the worst thing that you can do because it only serves to validate what they say if men like us stay quiet about these things.",

If it is impossible for you to safely address this with your parents (they\u2019re abusive, etc), then does your school offer counseling services?

You can find another adult you trust as well, like a family member, friends\u2019 parent, or teacher.\r\n\r\nDo you have health insurance? If you do, you can call the customer service number on the back of the card and ask them what providers you can access near you. Please know that they send service summaries every few months by mail, so your parents might find out about it like that.\r\n\r\nIf you dont have health insurance, call places like Planned Parenthood and ask about resources.\r\n\r\nAgain, you absolutely should talk to your parents if the only thing holding you back is  feeling embarrassment or feeling scared of disappointing them.

It's arbitrary and required by American insurance companies to make it easier to decide who does and doesn't get certain support. It has nothing to do with how autism is actually experienced, the true needs of the individual or the impact autism has on someone's day to day life. The chart takes something that's already overly simplistic and simplifies it further to the point of meaninglessness.\r\n\r\n It's sexist too, it minimises autism that's more typically experienced by women by emphasising the elements that are visible to an outside observer. Having autism that is less immediately obvious doesn't mean it's experienced less severely by the individual, all it does is turn it into an arms race and pit individuals against each other in a bid to get inadequate support. \r\n\r\nThe way it inevitably functions as a system is that people labelled as \"level 1\" have little to no access to support because their needs have been minimised to the point of pretending they don't exist and people who have been labelled as \"level 3\" suffer due to low expectations and the assumption that visible autism automatically equates to a limited intellectual capacity. They're essentially functioning labels with a badge job. No systemic change to the understanding of autism has happened in the medical and psychiatric community, they've just relabelled the old labels for the convenience of lumping all people who look similar into one bucket; refusing to acknowledge that each person is unique, with unique goals and needs. Effective support must be tailored to each person, with funding available to meet each person's unique needs.\r\n\r\nI'll get off my soapbox now.

I frequently subconsciously \u201cdaydream\u201d about things I have done in the past that I find embarrassing or annoying and it literally makes me want to die. These are unsubstantial things that probably no one else remembers about me but they absolutely haunt me. Does anyone else experience this? How do you cope with it?",
        "answer": "It's common for people to dwell on embarrassing memories because they can be emotionally charged. I personally have had this happened to me many times, mostly in periods of my life where my anxiety was more heightened.\r  \r\n\r  \r\nOne way to cope with embarrassing memories is to practice self-compassion. This means being kind and understanding towards yourself when you have these thoughts, rather than criticizing or berating yourself. It can also be helpful to remind yourself that everyone makes mistakes and has moments they're not proud of. It is not worth thinking too much about those moments, I promise you everyone has had embarrassing moments.\r  \r\n\r  \r\nAnother strategy is to reframe the memory by focusing on the positives. For example, if the embarrassing memory is from a social situation, you might remind yourself of the friendships or connections you made in that situation, rather than dwelling on the specific mistake or embarrassment.\r  \r\n\r  \r\nYou can also try to distract yourself when you find yourself dwelling on an embarrassing memory. Engaging in activities you enjoy can help you build more confidence, and this confidence will counteract or override the feelings of self consciousness over these memories. Focusing your time in and effort on practicing a hobby or doing a pleasant activity is key,  because you will feel better afterwards with yourself too. Personally this is what helped me the most to stop dwelling in awkward memories. \r\n\r\nI hope this helps!",

He has never had anything like this before. When it happens, he\u2019s so terrified and panicked and he just keeps yelling for me to help him. I can usually get him out of it by taking him to the shower or something else to change his surroundings, but he says everything is \u201csmall\u201d for a while afterwards and then eventually goes back to normal.\r\n\r\nThe hallucination is mostly auditory and he says it is triggered by his breathing, the sound of his covers moving, or any other soft noise like that when everything else is quiet. Once it starts, he says it\u2019s like a whisper screaming that keeps getting louder. The whisper scream was saying negative things at first like \u201cthat was so easy, why couldn\u2019t you do that bro\u201d and stuff like that, but I don\u2019t think he always hears distinct words. He also explained a bit of a visual that sometimes goes along with it, but he only sees this with his eyes closed. He said it\u2019s like a game where two balls come together and then the negative voice starts. It\u2019s not always the same and seems to be evolving a bit. He starts crying and freaking out when this happens saying \u201chelp me mom\u201d and \u201cwhy is this happening?!\u201d. His vision is affected afterwards for a short time with everything looking \u201csmaller than usual\u201d to him.  It\u2019s been almost every night for the past week. It started last weekend and he thinks it\u2019s connected to watching the movie Spirited Away. \r\n\r\nThe best nights are when I give him benedryl (did two nights) and I do a meditation with him to get him to sleep. The benedryl seems to keep him from waking at night where it would start again. But tonight, no benedryl and he woke up twice hearing the thing and completely panicked worse than ever before. I was able to help him after a shower to get back to sleep eventually. \r\n\r\nI\u2019m lost and scared for him. I don\u2019t know what kind of doctor to start with for this, but we need someone\u2019s help asap. Do I need a psychiatrist? Neurologist? Therapist? I\u2019m so lost and afraid. I don\u2019t know how serious this is. Our health ins sucks and not a lot of docs take it. Do I talk to his GP? \r\n\r\nOutside of this, he\u2019s a completely happy, smart, strong & independent kid. He has friends and makes friends easily. He is doing well in school and loves soccer and basketball. Nothing traumatic has happened to him and our family is solid and loves him and his older brother with all our hearts. \r\n\r\nVarious people in our family have had issues with anxiety and depression.

Hi, I'm [30F] a first time poster that's looking for some sort of direction, specifically for trying to understand my sister's [28F] mental health quirk.\r\n\r\nFor about 10 years, she has been seemingly adopting into her history, things that have happened to me. For example, she recently started retelling my story of riding a bike for the first time as her own story. She vehemently insists it happened to her, even though my father and I know it was my story since we were all there. There are several other examples, but she always get annoyed that \"I'm trying to steal her history\" even though it's the other way around lol.\r\n\r\nIs this a symptom or trait of anything specific?",

It took me until we\u2019ll into adulthood to reach this level of maturity. \r\n\r\nI honestly never considered that it could be mental illness.

        "answer": "Hey bro. It\u2019s ok. Don\u2019t be so hard on yourself. The energy you\u2019re using is sacred. Maybe do some research and read books on your sacral chakra. Learn the benefits of retention. Challenge yourself to not orgasm, be it with a women or on your own. It\u2019s hard during the first week, and 2nd\u2026 and doesn\u2019t actually get easier. But what you\u2019ll notice as time passes is the increase levels of self belief and confidence you have, as well as energy. More time to do things you want as opposed to wasting it seeking sex. The whole journey starts with apprehension. As soon as you think about it you\u2019ve initiated foreplay. When you feel like you\u2019ve hit the point where you\u2019re going to seek it out. Cold shower for 5 minutes. It will reset you. Keep a journal of your retention journey. And if you can go for a month and journal it, you\u2019ll see how happy you are with your progress. Also think about the money you save. So much growth in so many ways, by simply not giving up your sacred energy. Just my 2 cents.",

        "answer": "Its normal if you were critized/blamed as a kid much. If you didnt feel save to express your authentic self. If you had to hide parts of yourself to be loved. If you were only loved if youd performed. If you pleased your parents because you were afraid of them getting mad. It leaves wounds that are triggered in adult life. These wounds or traumas can heal, but it takes time and probably therapy. \r\nYour body remembers rejection/critisism as something veeeery painful. Your brain is a computer that works automatically on pattern. It recognizes rejection and it will present to you an automatic negative and painful feeling.\r\nIf you find yourself reacting overdone or extreme in relative normal situations, you prob have a unhealed wound or trauma. Therapy can help you with it!

However, if you say \"You cannot smoke.\" you are trying to control what someone else does, not yourself. You cannot make someone stop smoking, that is not within your power or right. You can however choose to not date people that smoke.\r\n\r\nI have boundaries around my relationship with my mother. I can't change her, but I can choose to stop engaging with her if she crosses a boundary I've set for behavior I'll accept or not. It can feel like imposing a rule or trying to control someone when they hear that you won't do something if they do something, but life is about choices and when you decide you don't do something if they do, they then have the ability to choose to be with you and conform to your boundary, or decide they'd rather do the thing you don't want and not be with you.",

        "question": "Addiction and Relapses I have a question for anyone who has ever been physically addicted to a substance. I have heard many times that if you are \"clean\" for a good length of time and then relapse; the addiction comes back immediately. Is this true? Or is that simply a result of the mental desire that caused the relapse in the first place? \r\n\r\nI have a history of substance abuse myself, but I've never been physically addicted to anything more than caffeine and nicotine. I've \"relapsed\" on the caffeine many times and not had much of a problem with the \"physical\" addiction (except fatigue from withdrawals). As far as the nicotine, once I finally came clean of that; I never looked back. \r\n\r\nIn short: If you relapse after being clean for a decent length of time (a year, for example), does the physical addiction automatically return? Or does it simply feel that way because the mental desire caused the relapse?",
        "answer": "Depends on how long you've been using for but opiates, at least in my own experience, it takes me no more than 3 days to be physically addicted again. I was using for a long time though so others miles may vary. If I ever decide to treat myself I never use for any longer than a day and even then I still get a very slight withdrawal. I know others experience the same with alcohol as well, and benzos for that matter! Personally I don't get physical withdrawals from caffeine or nicotine only mental ones which don't last particularly long. I don't know if any of this helps answer your question but should point you in the right direction I hope! \u270c\ufe0f",

        "question": "What is going non-verbal? I've seen some autistic people on the internet talk about 'going non-verbal', but I've been having trouble finding further information on the topic. What is going non-verbal and what does it feel like?",
        "answer": "\"Going nonverbal\" isn't really a real medically documented thing, it's just the way some people like to describe selective mutism, which is a medically documented condition unrelated to autism. Nonverbal in regards to autism means someone born without the ability to speak at all or they are only able to use an extremely small vocabulary at all times. You can't really \"go\" nonverbal from being perfectly verbal, it's either you're born with nonverbal autism or youre born with the ability to speak. There is no in between. A nonverbal autistic person can not speak because of a condition called apraxia of speech which is caused by severe autism and severe developmental deficits. Apraxia of speech can not come and go, it's not a spectrum, it's either you have it or you don't. If you have apraxia of speech you can not talk at all ever or you have an extremely limited vocabulary at all times. \r\n\r\nIf you are normally able to speak but in some moments you cant, you don't have apraxia of speech, you aren't nonverbal, it's not caused by autism, you just have selective mutism. I honestly don't really like how autistic people who do not struggle with apraxia of speech have co-opted the term \"nonverbal\" as if it can be compared to nonverbal autism caused by apraxia of speech, when it's really just selective mutism unrelated to autism. \r\n\r\nSelective mutism isn't caused by autism or developmental deficits, it's a condition caused by anxiety and it can occur in anyone, not just those with autism. It is just very common in autistic individuals due to social anxiety being so commonly comorbid. Search Google for selective mutism if you want to find info about this.",

        "answer": "Even as a minor, your therapist should not share details about your sessions with your parents. From a professional standpoint, this violates the therapist/patient relationship. It's also a conflict of interest for your therapist to be friends with your parents. It doesn't matter whether your parents pay for your therapy; you have the right to keep your therapy sessions private.\r\n\r\nYou're not overthinking. Maybe this therapist isn't telling your parents everything. Your parents may be bringing up things from your therapy sessions due to queues you're unconsciously giving or out of coincidence. I would still strongly consider switching therapists. You should have a therapist that isn't a friend of your parents and is outside of the hospital network that your mother works for.\r\n\r\nIf your therapist is a professional, they will keep their emotions out of the equation and encourage you to do what you think is best for your mental health. Even if they're perfectly innocent of what you think might be happening, the fact that you think it is happening is damaging enough to the therapist/patient to warrant finding a new therapist. You need to be able to feel comfortable telling them anything without fearing the judgement of others; you can't do that if you suspect that they're telling your parents everything.",

I also can't shake the feeling that I'm running out of time. It feels like if I don't do something with my life soon, it'll be too late.

It\u2019s normal to feel like this. You Don\u2019t have to stress yourself all the way here to 26, please don\u2019t spend your time scared. 30 is nothing, all of my friends just have cuter parties compared to the hectic and chaotic ones in their 20s. You will be fine. And if things go wrong, it\u2019ll hit me first so you\u2019ll have time to prepared. You have time!!!! Breathe and enjoy being 22, at least for me if not for yourself!!!",

When I speak, I structure it and I think about conveying that information in the same way I'd consider how to convey it through the written word.

        "answer": "I suggest looking into Internal Family Systems therapy to help with this. Main takeaway is not to demonize any self harm thoughts but to listen to them with curiosity and compassion. You can investigate why you wanna kill yourself and see the good in that intention like maybe you\u2019re trying to save yourself from misery or permanent pain, and then from that same calm space, you can thank yourself for caring to prevent pain but state that the plan is self preservation over self harm. \r\n\r\nThe intrusive thoughts can come from not having dialogue between that calm, most current/ present version of you and those parts of you that are hurting more and carrying pain. Just trust that you can hold space to love yourself and create that internal safety in your dialogue. \r\n\r\nFrom your comments/post: \r\n\r\nPart A: fear of being suicidal; demonizing that like saying you\u2019re scared of going \u201cinsane\u201d \r\n\r\nPart B: suicidal; probably really hurting and trying to show you an escape route you clung to before learning healthier coping skills \r\n\r\nYou can speak to these parts of you and offer compassion and understanding and listen without trying to change them. Understanding the positive intent can make the thoughts less scary while also allowing you to calmly decide not to act on those thoughts- like if you understand the suicidal thought is coming from insecurity and wanting to not feel insecure, you can reason with that part of you that insecurity is not permanent, so you won\u2019t react with a permanent solution. That\u2019s just an example. \r\n\r\nSending love and healing your way. Keep it up on the asking for help part. \ud83d\udc95",

        "answer": "It really depends on the concert, I love heavy music (Thrash Metal, Death Metal, Deathcore, etc.), This is what I've learned from going to concerts: Ear plugs help a ton, they also protect your hearing if it's a particularly loud concert. Most places with mosh pits have areas that are less populated so you don't have to make physical contact with anyone, keep a phone with the vibration on so you can easily keep in contact with anyone you may need to contact and ask that your group do the same, it can be easy to get separated from them so it's good to have a text based way to communicate. Be aware of the toilet situation, they're usually crowded and stink horribly. Eat before you go to the concert if you can as food May be non existent, and plan on drinking bottled water if you get thirsty, it can get hot with that many people in one place.

I am an adult (25) but I read that the parents of an autistic person can gain legal guardianship of the child, no matter the childs age and this terrifies me.

To make matters worse, she works as a caretaker for disabled people, so she definitely knows about all this stuff.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnother reason is that I likely won't get any private insurance, which sucks since I am self employed.

        "question": "Since the term \"Asperger's syndrome\" has fallen out of favor, is there a better term for this variety of autism? I don't know much about ASD \u2013 but it seems like the term \"Asperger's\" was useful to denote a certain part of the autism spectrum, characterized mainly by social impairment.\r\n\r\nNow that Asperger's syndrome has been removed from the DSM, and Hans Asperger's collaboration with the Nazis has been more widely acknowledged, I understand that many people prefer to avoid the term.\r\n\r\n**ETA:** I understand that Asperger's wasn't removed from the DSM *because* of the Nazi connection. I don't know where people are getting that. I was citing (1) the removal from the DSM, and (2) the Nazi connection, as two *separate and unrelated* reasons that people might prefer to avoid the term.\r\n\r\nI'm just curious: is there another term which means \"a kind of autism mainly defined by social difficulties\"? Is Asperger's the same thing as \"high-functioning autism\"?\r\n\r\nThanks.\r\n\r\n**ETA 2:** It seems that the answer to my question is \"Level 1 Autism Spectrum Disorder\". Thanks to those who answered the question.\r\n\r\n**ETA 3:** A lot of commenters have pointed out to me that \"ASD is a spectrum\". (I know this \u2013 I used the word \"spectrum\" in my very first sentence.)\r\n\r\nI think that our confusion stems from a difference in understanding of what the word \"spectrum\" *means* in this analogy. I've always understood it to mean something like \"gradient\" \u2013 with people who can live independently in an NT world at one end of the spectrum, and people who need a lot of support at the other end.\r\n\r\n(In my experience, that's absolutely how the term \"autism spectrum\" is generally understood among the general public. That's also how it's described in many general-audience resources about autism.)\r\n\r\nHowever, I'm seeing other resources which suggest that it isn't *cases of autism* that are distributed on a spectrum, but rather *symptoms* \u2013\u00a0[like this](https://carmenbpingree.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-13-at-4.30.12-PM.png). And each person with autism experiences a different subset of those symptoms. According to this interpretation, the \"spectrum\" has nothing to do with low support needs vs. high support needs.\r\n\r\nThat's actually a more sensible analogy for the word \"spectrum\" \u2013 but, again, it's contrary to the \"gradient\" analogy that I've always heard in the past. And given that many medical resources \u2013 and even people *in this thread* \u2013 endorse the \"gradient\" interpretation, it seems fair to ask: who gets to declare which interpretation is the \"correct\" one?\r\n\r\nI'm glad to have gained a better understanding of this, but I do wish someone had just politely said \"people often use the word 'spectrum' to mean 'gradient of support needs', but some people use it to mean 'variety of possible symptoms'\".\r\n\r\n**ETA 4:** And now that I've looked further into it, I'm finding *still other* interpretations of the \"spectrum\" model (being offered by autistic folks). A lot of people seem to be *really confident* that they have the One True Interpretation of the term \"autism spectrum\", and that other interpretations are Wrong.

When someone says something is \u201cgross\u201d or weird, we ask why and expect logic.",

I have Asperger\u2019s/high functioning autism so my people skill are basically nonexistent. I really don\u2019t get much emotional pleasure out of relationships. This brings me to my question. It feels weird that I can\u2019t get super attached to real people, but I get seriously attached to fictional people. Every time a character dies or experiences suffering, I wish I could be there to help them avoid it. A lot of times this manifests in daydreaming. Whenever a show ends, I\u2019ll hold conversations between myself and the characters whenever I\u2019m driving, walking, or doing some other menial task. Can anyone relate to this? Am I asking the right group?",
        "answer": "For my work, I help people with autism improve their communication, and this is a fairly common happenstance I encounter. \r\n\r\nMy supposition is that, from a communication standpoint, fictional people can paradoxically seem more \"real\" due to the written medium being much easier to interpret because the details are all there in black and white. The reader is provided details by an omniscient third person narrator that specifically describes the characters mental functions and states. So one can be told both the actions and motivations of characters in a way that is never available and always significantly harder to interpret in real life. First person narratives can be even better at providing this information directly to the reader, eliminating the potential for communication breakdowns that generally cause difficulty in the lives of many people with autism. \r\n\r\nThe imagining of mental scenarios involving the fictional person then becomes both easier to imagine, since one is explicitly told their mental states and the particulars of their problems, as well as more satisfying because one can imagine being helpful in a way they struggle to be in day to day life. There is absolutely nothing wrong with such fantasies and imaginings, because ideally they can become the basis for real life interactions. \r\n\r\nJust keep in mind the reasons why you are finding a world with all the blanks and motivations filled in more enjoyable.",

Everyone has been encouraging me to do a vaginal delivery and talking about how I definitely do not want a C section unless it's medically necessary. I feel like it IS necessary but no one else seems to understand why I think it's the better way to do this. I have bad sensory issues, plus a heart condition and get severe chest pain when I'm stressed which has been happening every time I get contractions even though I'm already on medication for my heart. The doctor talked to me about it for barely 2 minutes and said I'd probably be fine if I just get an early epidural. \r\n\r\nThese contractions are what everyone says are the \"mild\" ones and that they're going to get much, much worse when I actually go into labor. I can't deal with what I've been going through already, it's beyond uncomfortable. I haven't slept more than an hour or two a night for the past week because of the pain and anxiety and I feel so awful by now. There's NO WAY I'll be in a place to mentally handle 24+ hrs of labor. Even if I somehow don't have a heart attack during delivery I think I would be severely traumatized by the whole experience. \r\n\r\nI can't stand the thought of going into labor without having a huge panic attack. I want them to take the baby out. I just get told it's normal to be nervous and I'll be fine and not to take the easy way out. The only one who understands why I want to do this and thinks I'm right is my baby's father who is also autistic. My reasons make sense, right?

I was diagnosed as autistic, but I can't bring myself to believe I truly am. I think that it is very likely that I only have ADHD.\r\n\r\nThe thing is, I have no issues interpreting people at all. Feelings, sarcasm, cues, everything comes as easily to me as it does for a neurotypical person. This is something I never heard of on an autistic person. \r\n\r\nThe autism symptoms I have that I believe convinced the neuropsychologist that I'm autistic are: \r\n\r\n\u2022 I have especial interests (often it's hard to think of something else tbh)\r\n\u2022 I can't do something different without being warned about it days before\r\n\u2022 I feel uncomfortable when something that is usually in one place is now on another place (the Twitter updates make me want to punch Elon Musk bc of it, btw)\r\n\u2022 I feel uncomfortable if I have to eat on a plate that isn't the one I'm used to (depending on the plate, I rather have the work of putting the food on another one and washing the first plate than eat on it)\r\n\u2022 I have very mild sensory issues\r\n\u2022 I self-soothe through repetitive behaviours\r\n\u2022 I stim a lot (both for coping and bc of happiness)\r\n\u2022 I have no impulse control (which results in some random compulsions, like clicking on every \"show replies\" button on the Twitter threads I open even though I have no intention of reading those replies) \r\n\u2022 I feel overwhelmed with social interactions quickly, and need to isolate myself to walk in circles for a bit \r\n\u2022 I have (very bad) executive disfunction\r\n\u2022 I can't switch tasks without preparing myself for a while \r\n\r\nAlso I don't know if this is an autism thing but I can't pretend to feel something I'm not feeling nor can I act in a way I wouldn't act naturally (like being formal), not because of morals, but because it feels like lying and that feels very, very uncomfortable even if I know it isn't hurting anyone and sometimes even benefiting people. \r\n\r\n(Of course I also have symptoms that are due to ADHD only, but I won't list them bc I know I have ADHD) \r\n\r\nEvery symptom besides the first 4 are also ADHD symptoms, and maybe it's not that I have special interests, but that it is hard to find something that interests me so I focus a lot on the things that do (I feel like I am reaching about the special interests. I feel like I'm lying. It is actually making me uncomfortable. But it is a theory, either I actually believe in it or not.) \r\n\r\nDoes this sound like autism to you??\r\n(I'm a 23yo woman if that makes any difference)",

I had a cold, and tried to take a bunch of cold medicine in the middle of the night to fall asleep. It just made me really high, and afraid i would die. That was the first time i ever woke my mom up when i was having one. 3 days ago, monday, i was in class at 10:15. I had just taken 2 ibuprofen, when suddenly I remembered the cold medicine incident, and started having a panic attack. I had to call my mom to come get me, and she brought me home.

Its the worst in the morning, then throughout the day it goes in and out, and then is bad again before bed.

For context I moved into my current house almost 2 weeks ago and it\u2019s basically a house on top of a house so like a unit I have my own entrance at the back of the house up the stairs and my downstairs neighbour at the front I am 17 female (and I live alone here) and my neighbour I would guess 45-55 male. Just before at 8PM I was just in my living room which was the only light and I hear a knock at my door people never have came to my door before so I was confused and ignore it more knocking continued I turned off my light and didn\u2019t answer also I live in a. Very dangerous area eventually knocking stopped I waited about 5 mins and I grabbed a screw driver and I went to my bedroom which is near the door to look outside It\u2019s pitch black but I see a guy his wearing one of those orange work shirts that are reflective that is how I see him but can\u2019t make out his face or anything but he is waving a ton at me. I am scared and he could see the screw driver in my hand in the window I feel like now I\u2019ve been seen I need to open the door and see what\u2019s going on. I open it the guy says nothing and starts coming up to me on the steps still pitch black can\u2019t see him. I don\u2019t move but am holding my screw driver. And then He says hi and I recognise his voice it\u2019s my neighbour who lives downstairs. And I\u2019m like hi? And basically he says to me your home a lot aren\u2019t you and asks me when I am home what days and time and I just tell him when I have uni cause I\u2019m pretty much home other than that. And then he just starts talking about the landlord and how he doesn\u2019t like him and how he thinks our house is flooding and other random stuff like some houses he has seen that looks like ours and just going into random detail like about our staircase and stuff and saying he thinks he might get a plumber so asked what day would be good for me and then asked me for my number and I don\u2019t know it from memory so we agreeed to share our numbers later.

        "answer": "I like playing games that are sport related, but I don't enjoy competition-based aspects of sports. \r\n\r\nI enjoy casually kicking a soccer ball around, or playing baseball or football with my cousins. I might even enjoy. Small light hearted competition. But, once people become serious about it, it throws me off. \r\n\r\nI feel like a lot of times competition ruins it. People are no longer trying to make their bodies and skills the best because they love being able to do it, they just want to win, be better than others, or be famous. And then you get to the whole commercializing and monetizing and that's just ridiculous to me. \r\n\r\nI also think all sports should have leagues based on abilities so everyone can play at different levels. \r\n\r\nI don't like what the general idea of sports is, specifically in the US, but I enjoy some games.",

        "answer": "TLDR: Separate the art and the artist if you can, and keep any joy you can in life :) But if you can't do that, that's okay too. You deserve for your interests to be simple and good, and good for you.\r\n\r\nPlease, please feel free to ignore this post, if what you need from us is just some help to let you make peace with still loving HP. You can. That's okay. It's valid! But if you're not able to do that... Just for a contrast to the comments you already have... I can see why. I abandoned a special interest that had soured, and it was really difficult. At the time, I really needed to find other people talking about that. And I couldn't. So *just in case* that's where you are, here's an essay about it for you :) If you're not there, just don't read it :)\r\n\r\nI think some people can separate the artists from the art, and that's great for them. In a similar way, some people can view media as a product of its time, and so accept the level of casual racism, sexism, transphobia and so on that was socially acceptable at the time a show was made, or a book was written. If you can do that, genuinely no judgement - that's great for you, and it makes life much easier.\r\n\r\nBut, I feel like if you made this post, maybe you can't easily do that? I can't either. I have too much autistic hyper-morality, and I'm too black and white about it, and I can't think about a thing without considering the wider context it's situated in, and all the connotations of that, and all the implications of it. I can't support HP because I can't in any way legitimise JK or anything she stands for. I will never give my money, even as a click or a stream, to something that comes from someone I'm ideologically opposed to. That's my brain and how it works, and a lot of the time that's great. But it does mean I can't separate the art from the artist, so I can't engage with anything when I'm unable to forget it's problematic in these kinds of ways. \r\n\r\n...And the thing is, if the special interest is now inextricably linked to that kind of a conflict for you, it itself becomes a source of misery. Everyone says to separate the two, but being trans usually comes with societal trauma, and she's in the media making things worse - so it is genuinely triggering. If every time you try to engage with the HP world, you think of JK Rowling, her terf views, and her particular, insidious attacks on autistic AFAB people... Then you are actually retraumatising yourself, by trying to hold on to something that's become poison. Because it should be your safe place. And your coping strategy. And where you get to lose yourself. But instead it's an attack on everything you are. It's an attack once removed, because JK is the issue, not HP itself... But for some of us, engaging at all makes you feel complicit. And there's trauma enough for us in the world, without opening yourself up and letting it in.\r\n\r\nIf you can separate the two and make peace with it, good for you, go for it. But if it's causing you more pain than it's worth, you're allowed to walk away. Losing a special interest is awful, and it hurts for a long time, and sometimes for years. But if you want to go down that route... That's okay. It's not overreacting, because she's made it very clear that everything she stands for is an attack on what makes you you. She doesn't deserve you, and you deserve a special interest that makes you happy. Simply, uncomplicatedly happy. Trans joy is real; autistic joy is real. You deserve it. However you need to handle this <3",

Had it been effective for you? \r\n\r\nSeeking professional help is easily the best decision I've ever made and will ever make. My therapists have provided so much support, refused to give up on me, taught me coping skills to fight depression and anxiety and PTSD (Cognitive Behavioral Therapy and EMDR), given me a private place to express myself, taught me how to express myself, always given me objective feedback and advice on my issues, helped me keep my head above the water, helped me keep moving forward, challenged me, given me hope, inspired me, validated my struggles, shown me so much compassion, helped me think more objectively, helped me become much healthier, helped me with the grieving process, helped me be able to leave my home, and showed me that my life is worth living.\r\n\r\n>How often do you normally go?\r\n\r\nI usually go to therapy once a week, but there have been times when I've gone once every two weeks. \r\n\r\n>Does anyone have any legitimate experience with getting a certified letter from your therapist? \r\n\r\nWhile I do not have any experience with this, I know many others who have emotional support animals and service dogs.

Before I start, I want to mention that I have not been diagnosed with anxiety so far, but this is the only community where I feel like I can let this out and ask this question. (Also im new to Reddit and don\u2019t know how exactly this works, so if I do anything wrong please let me know) \r\n\r\nSo I\u2019m currently 18 years old and as for my childhood I\u2019d say it was okay. I was a pretty shy and \u2018good\u2019 kid so never got into trouble much. That\u2019s also why I can\u2019t recall ever being yelled at or hit. Maybe once, but my parent did apologise and state what they did wasn\u2019t okay so I don\u2019t think that would have affected me.\r\n\r\nHowever, I get so anxious when I hear anybody yell. It doesn\u2019t even have to be directed at me. A few examples: one of my teachers has a pretty strong, loud voice. When he suddenly calls out a student\u2019s name while I\u2019m doing my homework, I pretty much flinch even though his tone isn\u2019t even angry. \r\n\r\nOr a few weeks ago when a classmate wasn\u2019t wearing a mask, a teacher followed them into our classroom and basically yelled at them for at least a minute. While this was going on, I forced myself to just look down at my notebook and focus on anything but the yelling. Though I tried to distract myself, my eyes were teary and I felt a lump in my throat and I was really tense for the rest of that class. I think that was the most anxious I had felt in years. \r\n\r\nMy sibling who is 12 can be described as a \u2018troublemaker\u2019 I guess. They\u2019re the opposite of me which can be good at times, but it sometimes gets on my parents\u2019 nerves. They don\u2019t listen, aren\u2019t okay with being told \u201cno\u201d and pretty much do what they want when they feel like it. Because of this I often hear my parents being upset at them and I\u2019ve heard my parent yell at them a lot. Sometimes I\u2019d be in the same room, other times I\u2019d be in my room and they\u2019d be downstairs. During these times I\u2019ll also get very tense and just have a horrible feeling. If I\u2019m in the same room I won\u2019t even say a word and just get up and leave because it\u2019s too much. \r\n\r\nI have no idea what to do with this. I have an intake at a therapist next week for some mental health related issues, should I bring this up too? And does this happen to anyone else? I really don\u2019t understand why this happens to me \r\n\r\nThank you in advance for the help :)",

Definitely bring this up with your therapist, perhaps they will be able to help that initial trigger, but regardless bringing up any trigger is only going to help you and your therapist work on a treatment plan. If this is your first appointment, try and spend a few minutes and just jot down the things, the moments, and the people that make you anxious. It\u2019s only going to help.

        "answer": "Definitely! I find a lot of really small things incredibly daunting - humans have a way of wanting to remain idle and fight against change.

The more I want to keep something to myself, the more it just spills out of my mouth, and as much as I try to tell myself to stop talking, I can't seem to. Then afterward, I'm hit by a massive vulnerability hangover, where I regret ever opening up in the first place and wish that I could take back everything I said, or make the person somehow \"unhear\" the whole conversation.\r\n\r\nI just called my mom to ask a brief question, and ended up revealing extremely personal details of my current life situation which I definitely, actively did not want to share with her. I know that what's done is done, but the regret is overwhelming.\r\n\r\nDoes anyone else experience something like this? Does anyone have any tips for how to calm myself down?

I don\u2019t live in the safest neighborhood, and I always try to calm down but it *could* happen. \r\n\r\nOr my healthy pet rabbit could die. Or *something bad* could happen.

I went through a really stressful event a few months ago which made my anxiety skyrocket. I have been suffering from chest pains that come and go but sometimes can last all day. It feels like a deep pain or intense burning on the left side of my chest. I\u2019ve been to numerous doctors appointments and have had ECGs, a heart echo, CBC blood test, and comprehensive metabolic panel. The doctor told me there was nothing wrong with my heart and that she would be shocked if a healthy 28 year old was having a heart attack. I am still convinced that somehow the doctor missed something. When I\u2019m in the midst of intense chest pain, it\u2019s hard to not want to go to the ER, but I can\u2019t afford to go to the ER every time the chest pain happens since it\u2019s so frequent. I would probably be there once a week.\r\n\r\nI\u2019m at a point where I\u2019m constantly anxious due to the chest pain which then is probably making the chest pain worse. And sometimes the pain comes up even when I\u2019m not feeling particularly anxious, which then makes me anxious. It\u2019s a never ending cycle.\r\n\r\nHow can I convince myself that I\u2019m not having a heart attack? Is it dangerous to just ignore chest pain and assume it\u2019s anxiety?

Sometimes my face gets numb and i get brain fog and it gets me so worried. \r\n\r\nAnxiety is like a bully the more attention you give it the more it torments you. Try breathing techniques and meditation. Breathing has really helped me get some form of control over my body. What helped me the most is exercise. Running or just walking around your neighborhood is a great form to relieve stress and anxiety. Distractions and hobbies will be your best friend. Its okay!

M and I will sometimes talk about our day, and after a little while of miscommunication and conflict we settled on a system where, if she's telling me too many details, I'll say 'faster' so she slips to the end (and the point) of the story. The reverse is the same - if I'm leaving out too many details, she'll say 'slower' and I'll add some more in. I'm very brisk and to the point and she likes to mention every minute detail and thinks that they're all equally important. \r\n\r\nMy question, no hostility intended, is why?

        "answer": "It seems you have an anxious attachment style. Attachment types are formed in childhood and directly impact how you interact in relationships. Without going into it too much right now, I can assure you are definitely not a bad person. I also used to be an anxious attachment type and felt all the things you listed \u2026. Feeling anxious when my partner wasn\u2019t around, checking my phone if he texted. The root of it is usually subconscious fear of loss. I felt like I wanted to break up with my partner too because it was so overwhelming. I started therapy and this is where I learnt about my anxious attachment style. If you have the resources available, I would definitely recommend therapy. It really helped my process my relationship anxiety and separation anxiety. If you don\u2019t have the resources available, simply google it and learn some tips on steps you can take to slowly become more secure. \r\n\r\nYou are worthy of the love you are receiving from him!!! You say he is great, sweet, romantic and well mannered. That is amazing!!! I know it feels scary when he leaves but remember he is totally into you! I learnt about things I can ask from my partner that helped ease the separation anxiety. Such as checking in, or simple reassurance went a long way. \r\n\r\nAgain, there is nothing wrong with you and you are not a bad person. Your attachment is simply activated. Once you have awareness, it helps because you can understand what is happening and why. \r\n\r\nWishing you lots of luck!! You got this!",

        "answer": "I'm gonna be real with you: being put in a psych ward against my will at 16 was slightly traumatic. BUT it was because of my personal circumstances. I was there for one week and I live in Hungary so I have limited experience and knowledge about what you're might be getting into but here's what I know nonetheless. I hope it helps. \r\n\r\nFirst of all I was already going to therapy and had a developing support system that I was taken out of. You on the other hand don't seem to have a stable support system at all and would probably benefit from the attention of professionals and people with similar issues (aka you could even make some friends although in my experience it is a hit or miss. But you will definitely benefit from hearing similar stories from people in similar but just different enough situations, trust me). ***If you feel like you need help you're probably right.*** Getting away from your parents, whatever the exact situation might be would also seem like a good idea based on what you wrote. ***In sum I definitely recommend talking to a therapist and it might even be beneficial for you to go to hospital*** although that depends on the hospital itself. Also you should definitely ask your therapist about being hospitalised, especially if you're afraid to be open because of the uncertainties surrounding it. They will have better answers suited for you than any of us here on reddit. \r\n\r\nI'm not sure about your local place's rules but in my experience and what I heard in other places as well they take your phone away. We had one hour daily to use our phones, which overlapped with the one hour that visitors were allowed so I practically couldn't use it at all because parents always bugged me to pay attention to them lol. Entertainment wise they provided a lot of things, from art supplies through TV to guided activities and even played with us if none of the other patients were willing so I didn't miss social media but I did miss being able to communicate with my friends.\r\n\r\nIf you get put in a hospital ***your legal guardian will know about it.*** I'm not sure if you can prevent them from visiting you as I never had an issue like that but you should talk about a doctor with it. I'm sure you're not the first one who would have an issue like that (if you even want to prevent them. That's just the vibe I got from your post). ***They will also most likely see the reports that the doctors write about you***, which can be very scary, I know. In my experience it doesn't contain very specific things, just general statements. For me these reports (or at least the parts in laymans terms) were 3-4 short paragraphs long where at least one would be taken up by my background (how old I was, what my hobbies were, where I went to school, etc). This was in every report, I assume, for the purpose of informing any other doctor or therapist that might take my case about the basic info needed about me. A report like this was produced after every one-on-one talk, sometimes including psychological tests. The 2nd-3rd paragraphs were taken up by the contents of these talks and tests, again, general tastements, almost bulletpoints about the most important things. The last paragraph would talk about diagnoses, suspected and outruled problems. ***So don't be scared because of this. Having your parents know about stuff is a necessary sacrifice for the betterment of yourself.*** This is also something I had to come to terms with and was very uncomfortable at first. But you have to understand that this is a \"necessary evil\" for things to get better.\r\n\r\n***GOING TO HOSPITAL  WILL NOT RUIN YOUR LIFE*** */in most cases\r\nUnless you get sent to a *very* bad mental hospital that worsens your condition, you will not really lose from this. For the duration of your stay there you will probably not go to school, unless they let you go online, however a lot of the time it's an important point to let people there take a rest from school or work. If that means missing an exam based on how severe your situation is they might just say that you'll have to take it next year. But trust me, they know what they're doing. If they say you need to miss the exam, you're probably better off missing that exam >!than killing yourself over it if you get what I'm saying!<\r\n\r\nRecord of you being there will of course be in your medical records and your GP will probably know about it. I think there are aa few diagnoses and medicines that would prevent you from driving a car for example or if you are very violent they might prevent you from becoming a teacher and prohibit you from getting a firearm. But these are ***extreme cases*** and >!unless you killed or raped someone!< getting a diagnoses will not have any serious negative effects. On the contrary it will greatly help you, your caregivers and your doctors in understanding your problem and its possible solutions so don't shy away from it. \r\n\r\nAlso, I'm not a lawyer but to my knowledge you have zero obligation to disclose your medical history to your regular ol' job provider unless it's relevant to the actual work. If anything this will only help you with overcoming your issues and being more balanced in the future - aka having a better life. ***I can't stress this enough. If you feel like you need help, get help! It will most likely actually help!***\r\n\r\nThroughout this comment I talked about ***inpatient treatment*** aka: you sleep there, eat there, shower there and can't leave unless they let you. Based on your specific circumstances you might be put in ***outpatient care.*** We had one outpatient girl who slept and showered at home. However from ~8-16 (I don't remember the exact time but for the majority of the day) she was mandated to be there in the hospital and follow the same rules as us aka: not leave without supervision unless allowed and follow the activities of the group. She ate with us, etc. but would go home at the end of the day. Whether you go inpatient or outpatient is based on some factors: First and foremost how much of a threat are you to yourself and/or others and how safe are you at home? If you are eligible for both inpatient and outpatient and the hospital has the capacity (aka: enough beds, food, caretakers, etc) they might let you choose what you prefer. After they let me out they said they'd welcome me if I wanted to continue this in outpatient care.\r\n\r\nLast addendum: I saw a lot of people comment bad things about mental health care in the states. I have no experience with that and hearing about the absolute state of american health care saddens me greatly. I might be a bit too optimistic because I had - regardless of some traumas - actual positive experiences with therapists and the hospital I was in. But that's Hungary. Please, ***please*** ask a local professional - either a therapist or your GP - about your situation before getting into all of this! I'm not even sure if you're in the states - regardless, ***ask someone local about this who know their stuff!!! ***\r\n\r\nI hope at least you get some idea about mental hospitals from this! And I really wish for your situation to get better <3 if you have any questions you can also just message me if you'd like, I'll answer everything I can(although I might not be the most experienced) I remember how scary it was not knowing anything that went on.",

        "question": "How to find help for a child when parents refuses to find help? \r\nA 13 year old who I have known since I was 14 needs help with her undiagnosed anxiety. She is basically a little sister to me and I love her so much. \r\n\r\nI see her mainly during school breaks. With each school break she visits I can see her anxiety getting worse. \r\n\r\nShe has panic attacks that cause her not to be able to speak. She wants to talk to people but she just can\u2019t. Her heart rate is really high for someone her age (140 at rest) and I\u2019m guessing that is due to her anxiety. She also self harms. \r\n\r\nHer family life isn\u2019t the best  her mom makes it obvious she never wanted her to be born and she hates being responsible. For example she allowed her child to go without education for almost 3 years and the excuse was the pandemic. The mom doesn\u2019t believe her child\u2019s anxiety is real. She says things like \u201cwhen she was younger she didn\u2019t have anxiety so she must be making it up\u201d I\u2019m not family I can\u2019t just take her to a doctor without parent permission. She really wants help when she comes over she tells me she needs to see a doctor for her anxiety. How can I get her help?",
        "answer": "Statistics from the UK's Nat. Inst. for Clinical Evidence: although this is not as effective as seeing a therapist, many people suffering from anxiety benefit from self-help. In recent years, evidence for therapeutic breathing has been very encouraging.\r  \r\n\r  \r\nThe self-help I'm describing here is not complicated.  \r  \r\n\r  \r\nWhen we have a lot of anxiety, it puts worrisome thoughts into our heads. There's two ways to get rid of those thoughts.\r  \r\n \r  \r\nOne is just to calm down. The easiest way to do this is to breathe slowly till you feel OK. Two psychiatrists, Brown and Gerbarg, say a 10 or 20 min slow breathing exercise is good and 20 min twice a day is a therapy for anxiety. The exercise is inhale and exhale gently, 6 seconds each.\r  \r\n\r  \r\nWhen you're calm, you can think your way through a problem instead of just worrying about it. Think about the worst thing that can happen, how likely that is and what you could do if it happens. In a stressful situation, think about the different ways you can respond and decide which one is the most intelligent.\r  \r\n \r  \r\nDon't make mountains out of molehills.\r  \r\n \r  \r\nWhen you use the thinking brain, you get control of the emotional brain, and you feel better.\r  \r\n \r  \r\nAlso, replace negative thoughts with positive thoughts. Count your blessings and remind yourself of your successes.\r  \r\n\r  \r\nThe treatments for anxiety range from simple stress reduction methods to therapy and medication.\r  \r\n\r  \r\nDon't overlook stress management - it can help even with very bad anxiety.\r  \r\n \r  \r\nVideo - a lot of helpful information, including the 3-part program of Brown and Gerbarg -\r  \r\n\r  \r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqEM\\_jlDRZI\r  \r\n\r  \r\n  Freedom from Self-Harm: Overcoming Self-Injury with Skills from DBT and Other Treatments \r  \r\n\r  \r\nThis book has been endorsed by Marsha Linehan, who created DBT, the best treatment for borderline personality disorder, which has serious self-injury as a frequent symptom. \r  \r\n\r  \r\nThere's a wide variety of treatments. Very severe cases require months of intense therapy but many people do well with a treatment that's just a booklet and a few therapy sessions, usually 2 or 3. \r  \r\n\r  \r\nTreatments that only reduce self-harm are considered successful. The less you self-harm the stronger you are and better able to deal with the problems that led to your self-harm.  Likewise, the better you are in dealing with the underlying problems the more it reduces the self-harm.",

        "question": "Is it true that many people with autism become social or political activists because they can't look away? I was just reading this Wikipedia article about Greta Thunberg, and it says that \"she thinks that the reason for so many people with autism becoming climate activists is that they cannot look away, and have to tell the truth as they see it.\" I found this very interesting, so I thought I would ask on this sub. Do you think it's true that many people with autism become social or political activists because they can't look away? Does it apply to you?\r\n\r\nPlease note I am not educated about autism, so if my question bothered anyone, I didn't mean to and I apologize for it. If possible, please explain how my question bothered you so I can learn.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nEdit: Thank you all for your answers, very insightful!",
        "answer": "Some of us have a very strong and delineated sense of justice which makes it difficult to tolerate the status quo. Some of us are also very fact-based in our thinking, which makes it difficult to dissuade us with disinformation. I think that many of us have also been on the receiving end of oppressive behavior, which makes it easier for us to identify with marginalized people groups. Maybe Greta Thunberg and I choose different words, but I can definitely relate with the need to \"tell the truth as they see it.\"",
