        "question": "Why suicide is bad? Maybe no one will see this question, but I'm left with taking the risk of asking. I have researched on the internet, reading books among other things. What I'm trying to find out is why suicide implies something bad for the person who commits it, leaving aside that we know the basics, like for example that they shouldn't do it because there is a solution and all that.\r\n But what I see is that the consequences only cover what their close social circle feels, despite this it is not clear to me why people are so against it, and I also don't understand the messages of all the campaigns out there, I would like to see other points of view to understand.",
        "answer": "low effort reply but: suicide must be largely frowned upon by the collective, partially because suicide being perceived as a bad thing leads to fewer people initially considering it. if suicide is neutral, it becomes more normalized, and thus becomes a more accessible point of consideration for some people. a lot of people who kill themselves would have gotten better if they had not. \r\n\r\nalso, most suicides are ultimately a product of material conditions. scores of people who are struggling (money, healthcare, addiction, employment) should not just disappear - they should be noticed, and their recoveries should be supported via structural change. when society/government fails to help individuals thrive, this collective pain should serve as a call to action. if people can simply kill themselves and this *isn\u2019t* an inherently bad thing, then there is far less reason to demand that material conditions improve for everyone.",

I (21F) am in ED recovery myself, but I just realized my partner (20M) (we\u2019re long distance but currently together for two weeks) is one of the \u201cbreakfast makes my stomach hurt\u201d people. I did the math yesterday and my brain finally processed just how much he wasn\u2019t getting his daily caloric & nutrition needs. (not divulging more information). I knew he didn\u2019t eat a lot already and have talked to him about it in the past, but it all just kind of clicked. I think his stomach hurts when he eats more because of an ED (I\u2019m not a medical professional). He also gets really bad migraines, so I don\u2019t know how I didn\u2019t piece all this together sooner. \r\n\r\nI was talking to him about it and he\u2019s open to trying to meet his daily food requirements in nutrients and calories. \r\n\r\nThe only thing now is I don\u2019t know how to go about it. I know he can get severe stomach aches (my guess is from under eating) and I worry if we just start trying to meet healthy amounts that it will trigger sever cramps and aches. Should we just try and power through if so? Or should be build up? I\u2019m also worried he struggle to maintain the healthier- necessary to live- lifestyle. I also don\u2019t know how this all would interact with trying to be more active in the new year considering he works in IT. (This is simply about muscle use, because he isn\u2019t active throughout the day)\r\n\r\nI just want a long, happy life together and I want his body to be well nourished.

        "answer": "Any therapists, dieticians, programs educated in ED will know that anorexia exists in all sizes.

Any further and I likely would not be typing this.   That was 5 years ago.   \r\n\r\nI started an intense outpatient treatment recently due to a relapse.   I asked for help much earlier this time due to a fear of organ failure again.

I was welcomed the same as straight sized people and those under weight.   Our treatment paths were the same regardless of our sizes.   \r\n\r\nAs a friend you can only do so much, your friend has to want help.   Please continue to be their support.   Research ED treatment in your area. Look up atypical anorexia and share your knowledge with them.   Don't ever sweep the anorexia under the rug and pretend it isn't there.   You may eventually tire of saying or attempting them to eat, your relationship may suffer...just keep being there, letting them know they and their health are important to you.

So really quickly over the past year or so, give or take, sometimes I've eaten a lot of food and then felt uncomfortably full, so to make myself feel better, not like to feel better about myself for eating to much, but to feel not stuffed I've made myself throw up. \r\n\r\nOne time I ate too much cheese on bread and after, I made myself throw up because I felt too full.

I had tears coming out of my eyes, from throwing up, not crying.\r\n\r\nThis time was kind of different from the rest because I made myself \"finish the job\", meaning I didn't stop until I felt like I had thrown up everything.

You are here asking this question for a reason. Talk to your therapist. Some of us feel more consciously \u201cin control\u201d of our actions at the beginning of an ED than others. In my case I was aware that what I was doing was considered \u201cdisordered\u201d, but I thought because I was aware of that and was \u201cin control\u201d of it, that I didn\u2019t have an eating disorder. It\u2019s amazing the amount of denial that can go on. I was actually sitting across from my therapist, who was an ED specialist, when it occurred to me that I actually might be Bulimic. I\u2019d been purging, bingeing, starving for 4 years at that point, and had asked for a therapist who understood EDs, because I related to the perfectionism that people with them had, but I didn\u2019t truly get that I, personally, had an eating disorder until I\u2019d been seeing her for probably 6 months.

Help",
        "answer": "Your heart can't fill with acid, only blood - I promise.\r\n\r\nVomiting is a lot of pressure and strain on the body, and it's easy to hurt small muscles in the chest. I don't know how long you've been throwing up, but acid issues are pretty common for people who live with bulimia. If it's not getting better, a doctor maybe can help with prescription acid blockers. A lot of people will wear out the \"valve\" that keeps acid in the stomach (it weakens when forced to vomit often), and that makes acid come up the throat sometimes, even if you lean over or in your sleep.",

        "answer": "hello! im saying this as somebody who has suffered with anorexia for almost 2 years\u2014 every person is different, so the same tips that helped me may or may not help her :). \r\n\r\n-frequent & different kinds of compliments always help me. my boyfriend has always given me different compliments every day, before & after i was diagnosed. things like calling me beautiful, gorgeous, dazzling, wonderful, pretty girl, etc etc. \r\n\r\n-make sure she knows you\u2019re there to support & listen to her. this might not be a tip for helping her feel comfortable in her body, i think overall its a great tip for anybody suffering with a mental illness like that. \r\n\r\nremember, that you can\u2019t just magically \u201cfix\u201d her ed\u2014 the most you can do is be there for her. you are not a doctor, you are not a professional, there is not much you can do. my biggest tip is ALWAYS to reach out and get your partner professional help. Although it\u2019s easier said than done, I would hate for her relationship with food to worsen. \r\n\r\nAs i said, ive battled with my relationship with food for a long time. Ive developed lifelong heart issues, my menstrual cycle stopped, ive been hospitalized multiple times, i have stomach & digestive issues, my metabolism will take years to fix, and so many other things\u2014 that is the unfortunate and ugly truth of anorexia. Anorexia is serious and it\u2019s good to get help before her physical AND mental health quickly starts to decline, because it surely will (if it hasn\u2019t already) if her bad eating habits continue.\r\nAs long as you make her feel loved and supported, you are doing enough. \r\n\r\nI wish you both the best and i hope your partner can recover safely. :)",

        "question": "How to overcome depression without therapy? I\u2019m a 20 yr old college student. Currently going through depression. On a scale of 1-10 with 10 being the worst, i\u2019d say it\u2019s a 7. The causes are loneliness (attachment issues), fear of rejection, and lack of confidence (voice, short attention span, lack of discipline, feeling behind for my age). I don\u2019t have many friends. I enjoy doing things like blogging, hanging out with people, discussing controversial topics, working out, and watching movies. however, i don\u2019t do these things often because depression makes me lazy. the only thing ive been doing consistently is going to the gym (2-3 times a week). it feels nice but doesn\u2019t help with depression. \r\n\r\ni know i\u2019m capable of so much but i\u2019m also really hard on myself whenever i mess up. i care so much about what other people think of me. \r\n\r\nSometimes, i don\u2019t feel depressed, especially when talking to family or friends, but that\u2019s probably because i\u2019m suppressing it. When i\u2019m alone or mess up in front of people or unintentionally do something to hurt someone (especially the person i\u2019m attached to), i feel it again. \r\n\r\nI\u2019d like to know how to overcome depression without going to a therapist? i WANT to do therapy but my parents don\u2019t believe it works. they told me to talk to them about depression but i have a hard time opening up. it\u2019s easier for me to open up with friends but i don\u2019t know, i don\u2019t want to be a burden. i don\u2019t want them to carry the weight of MY problems. also, talking to someone only feels good for a brief moment. once those negative thoughts and feelings resurface, i fall back into depression. it\u2019s really hard to change, it requires a shift in mindset and a shit ton of effort. I understand that it\u2019s a gradual process. \r\n\r\nSo just in case i fail at convincing my parents, i\u2019d like to know how to overcome it on my own.

Towards the end of my treatment (was there for 3 months) they eventually let me out of bed for rehabilitation exercises but nothing that was really calorie burning. I doubt they\u2019d let you exercise as it would probably be a trigger for others and they tend to really overthink everything that you do when you have an eating disorder.

I (35 m) live in Brazil, and if you saw the news that already says something about my mental health.\r\n\r\nI lost my job at the start of covid - was temporary. After a few months looking in vain for a new job, as no one was hiring, I decided to study again. Started learning Python, applied to public university, which is free, for a second graduation and was approved. I'm currently enrolled in an IT course in uni.\r\n\r\nI also started streaming to try a little income. It's a great experience and I love doing it, but it is very tiring.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile my wife was getting her salary and paying our bills, but this year she's been cut from her research until April, which means she'll only get paid in May. That never happened before and is the result of the incompetent and malicious administration of the former government.\r\n\r\nI do have a few freelance things I'm working on, in Python, but not enough to sustain us. But we also have some money in reserve, so it will be harsh but if everything goes ok, we'll survive.\r\n\r\nI'm still looking for a job, but now I have do dedicate a lot of time to uni and to learning.\r\n\r\nAlso I have a health problem that makes me sick in semi random intervals of time, around one or two times a month. When that happens, I may or may not start throwing up. That destroyed my confidence to look for presencial work, I'm focusing on remote job hunting because there's no way to know when I'll not be feeling well.\r\n\r\nThis health problem should have been treated already, but due to bureaucracy and some management errors, my treatment stopped. I'm in a queue to go through surgery, which should solve the problem, but now I can just wait. I'm thinking about restarting treatment, going to another doctor and all that, but the money we have is precious little for our necessities.\r\n\r\nAnd I'm afraid of the surgery. A relative of my wife went through the same surgery, for the same problem, and died in ic a few days later.\r\n\r\nI'm doing therapy, my therapist gives me huge discounts to guarantee I'll keep seeing her. She's focusing in traumas I have regarding my parents. They are still alive, they are narcissists and they abused me, verbally, mentally and in some cases sexually, when I was a kid.\r\n\r\nI also have depression since I was 12.\r\n\r\nMy father in law has been diagnosed with cancer in December. My in laws are the people who basically pay our rent, so we have a place to live and can keep studying.\r\n\r\nI think all I can really do is focus in doing my things, study and take care of myself to hope and try to aquire some financial stability. But I'm having problems organizing a routine. There's too much in my head. Some days I just want to be in bed and pretend nothing exists.\r\n\r\nI'll not enter in details about depression right now, but yeah.\r\n\r\nSo, how do you deal with too much on your head?

        "question": "Mom of teen seeking insight into my child\u2019s symptoms Concerned mom of teen - looking to learn from experiences of others\r\n\r\nI am a mom, and my oldest daughter is 17, nearly 18. She is a wonderful young person and the light of my life. For the last few years, she has been struggling openly with anxiety and depression. I have taken her to a few psychiatrists and she also sees a talk therapist regularly. She\u2019s been so far on only a few different SSRIs and is now on Zoloft, which seems to be working just a little bit better for her than other meds. Over the past year, her mental health has gotten even worse though and she\u2019s been quite vocal to me about her feelings of helplessness and wanting to get better. I am trying to do everything I can to figure out exactly how to help. She has a lot of signs that she believes may be autism. We do have lots of autistic people in our family, so this isn\u2019t a wild idea. She didn\u2019t have any of the typical early childhood symptoms though, but due to her own social media research, she thinks she may be autistic because if her feelings of burnout, need to stim for self soothing, dislike of certain textures and sounds, etc. I am open to this possibility but want to make sure we investigate all possibilities.\r\n\r\nWhat my concern is, is that she may actually be showing signs of early schizophrenia. If this is the case, I would like to get the right interventions in place before a major episode of psychosis potentially causes big problems for her. Here is why I am questioning whether this could be the case: 1) she says she sometimes hallucinates flies, as in she sees flies that she later realizes are not real. 2) Her mental health symptoms get worse at night. 3) She has lots of intrusive thoughts that really upset her, such as thoughts of grisly violent things, harm happening to people she cares about, imagining her beloved cat is dead, etc. I know she must have lots of disturbing intrusive thoughts about herself doing bad things, because she cries a lot that she is a bad person. 4) she admitted she did a very large amount of psilocybin mushrooms at one time (first time user and didn\u2019t know she was using too much) last year and said she had lots of hallucinations when she did it, and that she still gets vivid flashbacks of this. 5) she has paranoid thoughts and fears sometimes about things like there being people in the walls or attic. 6) she gets really upset about things sometimes if she makes a mistake like spilling a bowl of food and then she hits herself and talks about self harm. \r\n\r\nI am not sure if these might be early signs of schizophrenia or not. I have tried to do research and read some people say that hallucinations of insects were their first signs. I don\u2019t know how long it takes to go from that to big breaks in reality though. Can anyone share your experiences with me? I just want to help her but am not sure how. I am NOT expecting or asking for anyone to attempt to offer a diagnosis, obviously. What I am interested in is hearing from people with schizophrenia as to what your first symptoms were and how long did it take from those to first episode of psychosis? Also, if anyone with a diagnosis other than schizophrenia has had these same types of symptoms, what is your diagnosis? I am still working on finding the right professionals to take these things seriously and I would like to do my own research to take to the professionals as well and just to be more enlightened as to what might be going on.

        "question": "How to not become prejudiced after being abused? Hi at first I\u2019ll admit that I\u2019m writing this post after seeing something triggered my trauma very hard. \r\n\r\nSo to begin with a about two years ago I survived a 3 years long cycle of being both mentally and sexually abused by my girlfriend who was supported in the entire thing by her family (entirely female), also a lot of this came to be with them weaponising toxic patriarchal standards and stereotypes. This entire thing really badly skewed my view of women. \r\n\r\nAs someone who was always big on not generalising people and viewing everyone as an individual I somewhat overcame it in day to day basis to the point that I have no problem with the fact that most of my friends are female. \r\n\r\nBut still as a rather progressive left-leaning person I often visit internet spaces which are also frequently feminist spaces. And giving examples from Reddit (I won\u2019t give the exact subs names) I\u2019ve seen a lot of discussions about male abuse, mental health and effects of toxic masculinity on them. And unfortunately I\u2019ve seen a lot of women commenting (and being highly upvoted) things like \u201cthose problems are caused mostly by other men\u201d \u201cwomen are still most affected\u201d \u201cit\u2019s not our job to do anything about it\u201d today I even saw a comment (with 100+ upvotes) about how a man can\u2019t even be raped, and causes of man being SA by a woman are so rare that they aren\u2019t even worth taking care about. \r\n\r\nAnd I\u2019ll admit that seeing things like that triggers something in me and al that calm logical non-generalising thinking about which I talked about and which allows me to normally and friendly interact with women gets thrown out the window, and In filled with I m not sure how to exactly describe it but with some kind of mix of anger and extreme fear and resentment, feeling that that\u2019s how everyone views my experience and that what was done to me is somehow excusable or viewed as unimportant by most women. \r\n\r\nI\u2019m sorry if what I\u2019m writing is a bit of an incoherent rambling but I\u2019m not in a really good place right now\r\n\r\nI wanted to ask if anyone experienced similar feelings/issues with any group of people (not exactly women) caused by their trauma, and if you did, how do you dealt with it?",
        "answer": "Yes I have experienced exactly that and have even been banned from the lgbtq+ community for talking about my rape story publicly and one of the mods found it offensive because \"men can't be raped\". I don't understand the world view of a person like that or what kind of mental gymnastics you must undergo to find yourself in that level of self-brainwashing. I also was banned on the LGBT community for asking a simple question that wasn't offensive but I won't get into any of that because of how unrelated it is. However still I feel the need to mention it because of just how volatile that community can be when it all seems like they just want to stroke their offended ego instead of having actual conversations that are productive.\r\n\r\nHonestly the only way to deal with it is to advocate for yourself even when you experience backlash and to learn how to grow a thicker skin as harsh as that sounds but that is what I have found I must do in order to change anything. I know that sounds harsh to say but it is the lesson I learned because people on the internet are not going to be nice to you and if you want to survive it you must learn how to not let it get so far under your skin. It unfortunately will always affect you or at least it still does for me, maybe one day that will change. I really don't know if it will change but all I know is staying quiet is the worst thing that you can do because it only serves to validate what they say if men like us stay quiet about these things.",

If it is impossible for you to safely address this with your parents (they\u2019re abusive, etc), then does your school offer counseling services?

You can find another adult you trust as well, like a family member, friends\u2019 parent, or teacher.\r\n\r\nDo you have health insurance? If you do, you can call the customer service number on the back of the card and ask them what providers you can access near you. Please know that they send service summaries every few months by mail, so your parents might find out about it like that.\r\n\r\nIf you dont have health insurance, call places like Planned Parenthood and ask about resources.\r\n\r\nAgain, you absolutely should talk to your parents if the only thing holding you back is  feeling embarrassment or feeling scared of disappointing them.

I\u2019m a little confused what you mean by that but if you\u2019re waiting until you\u2019re sick with hunger to eat that sounds like it\u2019s still an eating disorder. Exercise is not going to summon your hunger, you\u2019re expending even more energy when your body is already trying to tell you it needs food, so you\u2019re only making the issue worse if you\u2019re exercising while starving. Try to graze on small bites throughout the day if a big meal is too much for you, just to get something in ur stomach. Aim for something with decent protein or fiber for energy, don\u2019t snack on just lettuce or something. Nuts, nut spreads and crackers, cheese, boiled eggs, veggies and hummus, all great options. And make sure you\u2019re replenishing electrolytes and drinking lots of water, the nausea could be from dehydration too. Eat dinner closer to bed time or have a little snack before bed if you\u2019re going to bed feeling hungry and waking up sick. You gotta honor your body\u2019s needs in order to start feeling better!

But then I kinda force myself to eat something else. I\u2019m at a healthy weight technically. But I wanna lose some body fat so I\u2019m doing like body recomp. Mainly focusing on eating more protein. And I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s the protein making my stomach hurt. Or my bulimic past. Like I wake up in so so so much pain.

My new diet or is this part of the recovery process ?",
        "answer": "**Recovery is not the time for weight loss.** Restriction (any diet that privileges certain 'safe' foods over 'unsafe/trigger' foods is restriction) is only going to cause b/p cycles. Your body is getting used to digesting food again, and I can see that being difficult on your bowels. I would suggest trying bowel rest, which means choosing foods that are easy to digest: oatmeal, bananas, rice, apples/applesauce, toast with peanut butter, etc. This will give your bowels an opportunity to readjust to digestion, which is what you should probably be focused on right now \u2014 rest & digest + recovery. Now is not the time for dieting.",

        "question": "Crippling embarrassment over insignificant things? I frequently subconsciously \u201cdaydream\u201d about things I have done in the past that I find embarrassing or annoying and it literally makes me want to die. These are unsubstantial things that probably no one else remembers about me but they absolutely haunt me. Does anyone else experience this? How do you cope with it?",
        "answer": "It's common for people to dwell on embarrassing memories because they can be emotionally charged. I personally have had this happened to me many times, mostly in periods of my life where my anxiety was more heightened.\r  \r\n\r  \r\nOne way to cope with embarrassing memories is to practice self-compassion. This means being kind and understanding towards yourself when you have these thoughts, rather than criticizing or berating yourself. It can also be helpful to remind yourself that everyone makes mistakes and has moments they're not proud of. It is not worth thinking too much about those moments, I promise you everyone has had embarrassing moments.\r  \r\n\r  \r\nAnother strategy is to reframe the memory by focusing on the positives. For example, if the embarrassing memory is from a social situation, you might remind yourself of the friendships or connections you made in that situation, rather than dwelling on the specific mistake or embarrassment.\r  \r\n\r  \r\nYou can also try to distract yourself when you find yourself dwelling on an embarrassing memory. Engaging in activities you enjoy can help you build more confidence, and this confidence will counteract or override the feelings of self consciousness over these memories. Focusing your time in and effort on practicing a hobby or doing a pleasant activity is key,  because you will feel better afterwards with yourself too. Personally this is what helped me the most to stop dwelling in awkward memories. \r\n\r\nI hope this helps!",

        "question": "How can i help with my friends ED I (14F) and my Best friend (14F) met eachother a few months ago. We get along really well and I love her so much but recently i found out that she has anorexia. \r\n\r\nSome time ago i installed Tumblr and asked her if she could give me her username. I'm pretty sure she Hestitated for some time but still gave me her username. When I saw her posts i literally froze. \r\n\r\nThe whole account was about her anorexia, pictures of her body (She has visible bones everywhere) and starvation diet.\r\n\r\nSome time ago she did told me she had anorexia but i was sure it was all in the past. So i started asking her about it and everytime she posted something I couldn't have a normal conversation with her without saying something about her ED. \r\n\r\nI started wondering if maybe i should message her parents about it (From what i know she has a good relationship with them and they had to deal with her ED before) but i was scared she might get upset about it, so i told her I'm considering talking to her parents. \r\n\r\nShe was a bit upset and told me about her ex friend who actually told her parents about her ED and that when she found out about it she started to dislike that person. \r\n\r\nI really don't want to lose her but I just can't stop worrying about it. \r\n\r\nSo what should i do? I heard that telling her parents is a good option only if it's really bad with her but when is it,, really bad\"? \r\n\r\n(Sorry for any grammar mistakes)",
        "answer": "What comes to mind for me (as an adult) is that you can talk to *your* parents.  Let them know what you saw, why you're concerned, etc.  Getting help for minors is primarily an adult responsibility.  What your parents choose to do with that information is up to them, and I think that your only responsibility in this is to remind your friend that you're here to be supportive of her getting the help she needs, with the understanding that it is likely professional help, and that as minors you guys can't really do that without parental involvement.  If your parents are not friends with each other, your parents can always contact a school guidance counselor who can pass along the concern, or they can reach out to them on facebook, etc.  \r\n\r\nYou can let her know how much the friendship means to you, how sad you would be if the ED took a larger and larger role in her life and got between the two of you, etc. but it's not your responsibility to care for her.  I will say that it's likely that her parents are aware of the ED from what you've shared, but maybe not aware of this tumblr account.  It sounds like something that isn't helpful for her to have, but managing what is or is not allowed on her phone is part of the parents' responsibility.",

I\u2019ve started CBT again and my doctor is discussing the possibility of anxiety medication as I suffer from debilitating over thinking (not diagnosed with anxiety).

I'd go out to netball training get there burst into tears then leave because I just couldn't go in and interact with people. After about 6 months of talking therapy and cbt, I still randomly felt awful, and the therapist caught me on one of these days. He was worried about me, and I said there's nothing else to talk about, I don't know why I feel like this I know my life is good and my past is behind me but I feel so upset for no reason and think about dying. He called my gp right away, since I've been on fluxitine. I feel so much better, and I haven't had one of these episodes where I just have to leave a social event. And if I do feel a bit nervous I just tell my self most people do suck it up bitch get  yay living or get busy dying. I'm 30 now. I feel lucky I've reached that attitude at this age. I know so many women I speak to don't get to that stage until they are about 50. I just don't give a damn about stuff like that anymore. No one in the gym is watching me, and if they are so what probably jealous or watching my form or maybe they are lonely and want a friend. I feel great. Honestly, it's bit of give and take you gotta want to take the mess and want to get better, and tell your self you will get better, I took about a month for mine to really help. But as long as you recognise yeh this is me I need help and I'm gonna take that help and use it to live my best damn life. You can do it.

He has never had anything like this before. When it happens, he\u2019s so terrified and panicked and he just keeps yelling for me to help him. I can usually get him out of it by taking him to the shower or something else to change his surroundings, but he says everything is \u201csmall\u201d for a while afterwards and then eventually goes back to normal.\r\n\r\nThe hallucination is mostly auditory and he says it is triggered by his breathing, the sound of his covers moving, or any other soft noise like that when everything else is quiet. Once it starts, he says it\u2019s like a whisper screaming that keeps getting louder. The whisper scream was saying negative things at first like \u201cthat was so easy, why couldn\u2019t you do that bro\u201d and stuff like that, but I don\u2019t think he always hears distinct words. He also explained a bit of a visual that sometimes goes along with it, but he only sees this with his eyes closed. He said it\u2019s like a game where two balls come together and then the negative voice starts. It\u2019s not always the same and seems to be evolving a bit. He starts crying and freaking out when this happens saying \u201chelp me mom\u201d and \u201cwhy is this happening?!\u201d. His vision is affected afterwards for a short time with everything looking \u201csmaller than usual\u201d to him.  It\u2019s been almost every night for the past week. It started last weekend and he thinks it\u2019s connected to watching the movie Spirited Away. \r\n\r\nThe best nights are when I give him benedryl (did two nights) and I do a meditation with him to get him to sleep. The benedryl seems to keep him from waking at night where it would start again. But tonight, no benedryl and he woke up twice hearing the thing and completely panicked worse than ever before. I was able to help him after a shower to get back to sleep eventually. \r\n\r\nI\u2019m lost and scared for him. I don\u2019t know what kind of doctor to start with for this, but we need someone\u2019s help asap. Do I need a psychiatrist? Neurologist? Therapist? I\u2019m so lost and afraid. I don\u2019t know how serious this is. Our health ins sucks and not a lot of docs take it. Do I talk to his GP? \r\n\r\nOutside of this, he\u2019s a completely happy, smart, strong & independent kid. He has friends and makes friends easily. He is doing well in school and loves soccer and basketball. Nothing traumatic has happened to him and our family is solid and loves him and his older brother with all our hearts. \r\n\r\nVarious people in our family have had issues with anxiety and depression. My son has also panicked before about being afraid of throwing up. \r\n\r\nCan someone give me some direction, insight, a starting point, anything?  Thank you so much.

        "answer": "1. Accept that you're doing this behavior (b/p) to make something about your life right now feel better. \r\n2. Accept that the bulimia is actually making everything worse. \r\n3. Accept that you will need to replace the b/p coping behavior with another, superior coping mechanism (such as medication, therapy, etc.) \r\n4. Accept that weight/fat has an outsized significance to you and that you need another source of self-esteem.\r\n5. Make a meal plan. Stick to it. (A dietician/nutritionist can help you with this.)  \r\n6. The cycle is this: Restriction (I just won't eat much, then I'll stay thin) leads to an intolerable desire for 'forbidden' foods ('trigger' foods, binge foods) which, once eaten, must be purged, leaving your body begging you for nutrition and hydration to heal itself, thus increasing your desire for those calorie-dense foods once more, even as you, now at the beginning again, attempt to return to your regular, restrictive eating.\r\n7. You must interrupt this cycle **at every step.**\r\n8. Do not restrict. No 'banned' foods. It's important to eat a couple of donut holes to show yourself that your weight will not spiral out of control, and that you can enjoy any food in moderation.\r\n9. Do not binge. See above. Buy your food in smaller quantities or divide your meals into perfect portions while you're in early recovery, if this helps.\r\n10. Do not purge. Even if you did binge.

Just help her remember that she doesn't want to die, let her know that you are there for her and will see her as soon as you can.\r\n\r\nI hope this helps.",

DON'T purge it, because then it will not go away. just listen to it, the more you commit to it without purging, the faster it goes away\r\n\r\nthink about it this way, every time you purge all the effort is being thrown away, and the cycle of extreme hunger will reset. so don't purge and just eat everything you want\r\n\r\ndon't worry about eating protein, because in extreme hunger even a whole family of chickens won't make u full lol\r\n\r\nwish u the best. listen to your hunger cues, you owe your organs a lot of food (:",

        "answer": "Used to have this when I was abusing lax. Usually a sign that your electrolytes are real out of balance.",

I'm constantly paranoid I might start hearing or seeing things that aren't there. This led me to think...what if I already have seen and heard things that aren't there and just didn't know?",
        "answer": "Thinking about schizophrenia cannot give you schizophrenia. HOWEVER, what can make you think you\u2019re going crazy & becoming schizophrenic is panic/anxiety. One of THE most common fears when experiencing a panic attack is the fear of going \u201ccrazy\u201d. While you may not be experiencing a panic attack, this sounds like an underlying anxiety issue.

        "question": "Does anyone else stop feeling anxious about something yet your mind and body still react to it as if you should still feel anxious? This is a strange question but I find that something specifically will trigger an anxiety response but then over time I learn that I don\u2019t have to feel anxious about it and the mental fear disappears. Yet, the memory of the initial situation or stimulus making me anxious seems to stick with me. It\u2019s like I go \u201coh yeah this thing isn\u2019t a big deal\u201d but my mind and body are like \u201coh, this thing means I\u2019m supposed to be anxious right now.\u201d It\u2019s like I\u2019m remembering feeling anxious rather than actually being anxious. Does anyone else experience this?",
        "answer": "Yep. That's the crux of the issue. You know it doesn't make sense to feel anxious about something, you've accepted it's not a significant problem, but your brain has already sent the signal to panic, and it's not easy to turn that off. It's kind of like having a fire alarm that goes off when you light a candle, and every stupid intrusive thought is a candle.",

Cold shower for 5 minutes. It will reset you. Keep a journal of your retention journey. And if you can go for a month and journal it, you\u2019ll see how happy you are with your progress.

These wounds or traumas can heal, but it takes time and probably therapy. \r\nYour body remembers rejection/critisism as something veeeery painful. Your brain is a computer that works automatically on pattern. It recognizes rejection and it will present to you an automatic negative and painful feeling.\r\nIf you find yourself reacting overdone or extreme in relative normal situations, you prob have a unhealed wound or trauma. Therapy can help you with it!

        "question": "I never have an appetite I honestly don't know if I have an eating disorder or not. I definitely have disordered eating...\r\n\r\nI have depression and anxiety among other things, and 10 years ago I began to completely lose my appetite and be unable to eat whenever I was under extra stress or extreme distress. Once the extra stress was gone, my appetite would return. Then, 5 years ago, after a time of extended and prolonged trauma, in which my appetite vanished, it simply never came back.\r\n\r\nMy type of depression is anhedonia, meaning I can't feel pleasure, enjoyment or interest in things. I am always bored and empty. I sleep all day. I haven't eaten in the day for years and if I try, I feel sick and it goes right through me within 30 minutes. I resent people who need to eat lunch. It feels so foreign to me. I feel like a robot who never needs food. My stomach never rumbles, gurgles or feels anything. It's like it is switched off and numb, like my ability to feel interest in anything.\r\n\r\nWhen I used to lose my appetite directly from stress, I'd drop lots of weight very quickly (and I was already slim) as I couldn't eat at all and just survived by sipping juice and iced tea, but nowadays, the only reason I'm not underweight is  because I binge eat chocolate, donuts, cookies, and everything sugary and sweet every night about midnight. It's the time I feel less anxious and can just zone out and watch Netflix or something, and stuff myself with sugar.\r\n\r\nLooking back, I then realised I've never eaten much during the day, and as a kid, I had issues eating breakfast and also lunch at school, due to anxiety. I could never finish my dinner either, though I could eat chocolate and cakes as my snacks after dinner, as again, at night time I was more relaxed.\r\n\r\nIs this an eating disorder? It is affecting my digestion and my life in general.",
        "answer": "I'm not a doctor, but it doesn't sound like one to me. An ED is usually characterized by intentional restriction of food due to poor body image, a desire to lose weight, and/or a fear of gaining weight. Having a low appetite due to depression is not considered an eating disorder, it's just considered a symptom of depression. However, my opinion is not a substitute for professional advice, so you might want to talk to your doctor about this.",

One of the most common signs of addiction is that it can get in the way of other things like relationships, work, health, etc. But do you believe it's possible to be addicted even if it has no (conspicuous) negative consequence to your life? For example, can someone be addicted to video games while still having a fully functioning work/life/social balance? Or for something to be an addiction, it has to be invasive towards one's life.\r\n\r\nI feel like smoking is one exception since aside from it being detrimental to your health long term, most smokers have perfectly normal lives.

I have heard many times that if you are \"clean\" for a good length of time and then relapse; the addiction comes back immediately. Is this true? Or is that simply a result of the mental desire that caused the relapse in the first place? \r\n\r\nI have a history of substance abuse myself, but I've never been physically addicted to anything more than caffeine and nicotine. I've \"relapsed\" on the caffeine many times and not had much of a problem with the \"physical\" addiction (except fatigue from withdrawals). As far as the nicotine, once I finally came clean of that; I never looked back. \r\n\r\nIn short: If you relapse after being clean for a decent length of time (a year, for example), does the physical addiction automatically return? Or does it simply feel that way because the mental desire caused the relapse?",
        "answer": "Depends on how long you've been using for but opiates, at least in my own experience, it takes me no more than 3 days to be physically addicted again. I was using for a long time though so others miles may vary. If I ever decide to treat myself I never use for any longer than a day and even then I still get a very slight withdrawal. I know others experience the same with alcohol as well, and benzos for that matter! Personally I don't get physical withdrawals from caffeine or nicotine only mental ones which don't last particularly long.

I find it really hard to believe sometimes that there's a life on the other side of this, that we're not all just getting through life with depression just part of the picture. I'm genuinely curious - are there people who just never had depression?",
        "answer": "I don\u2019t know about never being depressed ever. I battled depression for years BUT I did overcome it! There is hope!\r\n\r\nMedication definitely helped me at my worst point but I was still struggling with some depressive thoughts/moods. Now, I\u2019ve been off the antidepressants for a few years, and I\u2019ve been doing fairly well. I changed my living situation, my job, and I have a very supportive boyfriend. Life is looking pretty good for me. I still check in with my therapist every 4-6 weeks and occasionally fall back into old thought patterns but overall, I\u2019m doing really well.\r\n\r\nThings do get better, guys! I know it\u2019s tough to get out of bed some days or to feel like you\u2019ll ever be happy again but it can happen. For now, take your meds as prescribed, attend therapy if you\u2019re able to, and try to surround yourself with supportive people. One day you\u2019ll look back and realize just how far you\u2019ve come. :)",

For their privacy obviously I'm not going to list what happened to make their issues blatant, just know I'm not staring trying to see if people eat. I don't know what to do to help, but I'm essentially the gatekeeper of the food which seems unhealthy. Obviously I know not to nag or comment, but if anybody can help me with actions I *could* take, that would be much appreciated! They get a hot lunch and dinner, salad bar, continental breakfast, and a snack cabinet. Otherwise, all food is locked up, per house rules. I have to assume that losing control of your food doesn't help, so we already started leaving the salad bar accessible 24/7, and added a fridge in their kitchenette full of basic ingredients that they have 24/7 access to. The house mother is comfortable with us making changes, but like me, she's never dealt with multiple people struggling in one year. Neither of us is a doctor or therapist, we really just need to know what actions we can take to be supportive while the girls fight their own battles.",

I suffered from anorexia and I think having someone to prepare meals for me would have made a big difference. Everyone is different, but for me, it was the biggest challenge to cook for myself. Just by providing that service you are making a difference in their lives. \r\n\r\nI think you have enough available for them so that they can eat what they want/need outside of meal times. The most important thing you can do is be careful with your language. Don't label anything with calorie counts, and don't say any food is \"dangerous\" or \"a treat\". All food is good food, all calories are good calories. \r\n\r\nMy partner found a lot of books are articles helpful.

        "question": "Is my therapist allowed to share information with my parents? I (17f) attend talk therapy once every two weeks. I\u2019ve been going for a little over two years after I had a mental health episode that landed me in the hospital, and she\u2019s the only therapist I\u2019ve ever had on a consistent basis. \r\n\r\nWhen I first started going, I know my parents had access to my information because of the recency of my treatment at the hospital. But now I\u2019m 17, and I don\u2019t want my parents to have access to this info. I don\u2019t remember signing any releases, but it was a couple years ago. Further, my mom works at the hospital, and she\u2019s been friends with my therapist for several years. My parents pay for my therapy if that matters. \r\n\r\nAnyway, sometimes I share something with my therapist and then it seems to come up in conversations with my parents. Like maybe they won\u2019t bring it up directly and it may be a few days after, but it\u2019s always a little weird when they do. \r\n\r\nI don\u2019t want to stop therapy, and I think I\u2019m better because of therapy. That said, I need to protect my privacy. \r\n\r\nDoes it sound like I\u2019m overthinking? If I ask my therapist about it, will that impact my relationship with her? Should I ask my parents about it? I don\u2019t way to accuse anyone of anything, I just don\u2019t know what to do.\r\n\r\nI\u2019m just going to add that my parents have been worried about my mental health. I\u2019m nowhere near where I was when I was 15, but my parents frequently ask me about it. It actually played a role in the university I\u2019m going to since my parents don\u2019t want me going somewhere far away. I\u2019m literally going to a state university that is about 20 minutes away from them.",
        "answer": "Even as a minor, your therapist should not share details about your sessions with your parents. From a professional standpoint, this violates the therapist/patient relationship. It's also a conflict of interest for your therapist to be friends with your parents. It doesn't matter whether your parents pay for your therapy; you have the right to keep your therapy sessions private.\r\n\r\nYou're not overthinking. Maybe this therapist isn't telling your parents everything. Your parents may be bringing up things from your therapy sessions due to queues you're unconsciously giving or out of coincidence. I would still strongly consider switching therapists. You should have a therapist that isn't a friend of your parents and is outside of the hospital network that your mother works for.\r\n\r\nIf your therapist is a professional, they will keep their emotions out of the equation and encourage you to do what you think is best for your mental health. Even if they're perfectly innocent of what you think might be happening, the fact that you think it is happening is damaging enough to the therapist/patient to warrant finding a new therapist. You need to be able to feel comfortable telling them anything without fearing the judgement of others; you can't do that if you suspect that they're telling your parents everything.",

I have an extremally difficult relationship with food. \r\n\r\nAs a small kid, I was very picky and vomited without inducing various times each month. My teachers and relatives tried to make me eat, but I always refused or they forced me and I vomited. They tried it for YEARS without sucess, so they all just gave up so I could at least eat something.\r\n\r\nIn middle school (keep in mind I'm not from US). I've eat only noodles or bread daily. Yes, I had the condition to eat more than that, don't worry, I just didn't eat because I didn't felt like eating or was not hungry enough. In one part of middle school and high school I was in a school that I was 7 am but got there 6am and got out 5pm, got home almost 6pm. I didn't ate before going and I refused to eat all three meals they offered. In some days, almost never, can count in hands, brought a cookie to eat. Sometimes I gave it away, sometimes I ate only half. I got nausea and gagged when people ate around me, because of the smell of the food, because of the sight of someone eating, because of the vision of the fork moving in the disgusting food. It makes me sick. My mom didn't let me use the stove, so I couldn't make food for myself, either. However, I never wanted to cook, what would I make anyway?\r\n\r\nI'm still very picky. I still gag and want to vomit when people eat or when there's food around me. I ate a bit more and not only noodles and bread, even though bread is still my \"main food\". \r\n\r\nLast year one of my teachers asked me about it, because pretty much all my school staff knows I have problems with food. I told her. She said that she is like that too. That she has an eating disorder. I have anxiety so that is stuck in my mind. \r\n\r\nI don't have problems with my body, weight, face, hair and/or clothes. Yeah, some very small insecurities that go away very fast, but I don't really care about it. I was judged a bit when I was younger, but honestly? I do like how I look. Wish I was taller, but have nothing to do with an ED and I can't change it. \r\n\r\nThat said, it's even possible to have an ED without having appearance problems?

        "question": "I feel so bad for my teddy bear I feel like an abusive mother with him. Its an inanimate object but I literally feel like a mentally unstable mother who clings to her child for support while also neglecting the child. I literally feel guilt when hugging a fucking stuffed animal for comfort. He\u2019s seen me at my worst too many times and im ashamed of it",
        "answer": "Or to think of it another way: Your bear has seen you at your worst and has never left you. He came into your life with the job of comforting you, and he does it consistently and faithfully. He will never complain because being your companion is not a burden, but his reason for being. He will sit and listen to you, and the deepest, darkest corners of yourself are safe with him. He exists to be a constant source of solace, and asks for nothing in return. He will be with you for as long as you need, and if a time comes when you no longer need him, everything you put into your hugs, he\u2019ll take with him. \r\n\r\nTry giving yourself permission to have a comfort object, an item representing a safe space, and feel things without consequence or expectation. Your teddy bear is not a child - it does not need to be raised or nurtured, and it does not feel resentment or frustration from fulfilling its function. Its role in your life is to nurture you. You deserve to have a means to self-soothe.",

WOW, i never knew people related\u2026ugh. im relieved but also sad.",
        "answer": "I suggest looking into Internal Family Systems therapy to help with this. Main takeaway is not to demonize any self harm thoughts but to listen to them with curiosity and compassion. You can investigate why you wanna kill yourself and see the good in that intention like maybe you\u2019re trying to save yourself from misery or permanent pain, and then from that same calm space, you can thank yourself for caring to prevent pain but state that the plan is self preservation over self harm. \r\n\r\nThe intrusive thoughts can come from not having dialogue between that calm, most current/ present version of you and those parts of you that are hurting more and carrying pain. Just trust that you can hold space to love yourself and create that internal safety in your dialogue. \r\n\r\nFrom your comments/post: \r\n\r\nPart A: fear of being suicidal; demonizing that like saying you\u2019re scared of going \u201cinsane\u201d \r\n\r\nPart B: suicidal; probably really hurting and trying to show you an escape route you clung to before learning healthier coping skills \r\n\r\nYou can speak to these parts of you and offer compassion and understanding and listen without trying to change them. Understanding the positive intent can make the thoughts less scary while also allowing you to calmly decide not to act on those thoughts- like if you understand the suicidal thought is coming from insecurity and wanting to not feel insecure, you can reason with that part of you that insecurity is not permanent, so you won\u2019t react with a permanent solution. That\u2019s just an example. \r\n\r\nSending love and healing your way. Keep it up on the asking for help part. \ud83d\udc95",

        "question": "Med changes for bulimia? Sorry in advance for the long post...\r\n\r\nI started seeing a new psychiatrist in December and she also specialises in eating disorders. I didn't go to her specifically for my bulimia, but figured it was a nice perk. \r\nIn our first session, I told her all the meds I was on, which included Olanzapine (10mg) and Mirtazapine (45mg), which had been recently increased during my last inpatient admission last year. I also gave a general history of what I have been diagnosed with, which is when I mentioned the bulimia.\r\n\r\nShe asked me if I was a smoker (which I am) and how much do I smoke. When I told her she said that when someone is smoking as much as I do, it basically nullifies any therapeutic benefits of Olanzapine only leaving me with the side effects which include weight gain and increased appetite. So she gave me a plan for the following 3 weeks to come off it.\r\nShe also wanted me to start using Recovery Record again (eating disorder logging app) and link her to my profile so she can see how I am going, since she was concerned about how often I said I was binging and purging. Which was no problem for me since I already am logging everything on Lose It anyway. (I've actually been finding it interesting/helpful being able to log my moods, thoughts, behaviours, and urges as well).\r\n\r\nDuring our second appointment on the 27.01, she said that she knew from what I had explained during the last appointment that the bulimia was a significant issue, but she didn't realise how bad it actually is. That everytime she reviews her patient's on Recovery Record, I am always at the top of her list and always in the red. She asked me again if I would consider another eating disorder admission (first/last time I did an ED admission was in 2016) and I told her no.\r\n\r\nShe then said that she wants to take me off Mirtazapine as soon as possible. That because it significantly increases appetite and weight gain, that it was making everything even worse (apparently vets use Mirtazapine on animals that need to gain weight for various reasons, including due to cancer... which blew my mind!). That even though the CPTSD is the primary issue, that the binging and purging was making my anxiety and depression symptoms worse, which then feeds into the eating disorder, and it's just a vicious cycle. Her hope is that by coming off the Mirtazapine and starting a new medication, it will help with one piece of the puzzel. She explained that it wasn't going to get rid of the eating disorder, but maybe if I am not having as often and stronge urges to binge, that I won't be purging as much as I do.\r\nShe actually seemed a bit frustrated that I was not only put on these medications in the first place, but that they increased my doses during my last admission since I have a history of eating disorders.\r\n\r\nSO (lot of background for this one question, sorry), she instead wants to put me on Vyvanse. She said that it's an ADHD medication (which my psychologist is very interested in me trying because she thinks I have ADD), but it has been used to help manage Binge Eating Disorder. Since I am binging, it should help with these symptoms.\r\n\r\nHas anyone been put on Vyvanse to combat bulimia/BED? Have you found it helpful or not? I did a quick google and it does say it has been used for binge eating disorder but am curious to hear other's anecdotal evidence. \r\n\r\nIf you made it to the end... I am impressed haha thank you",
        "answer": "I have heard that\u2019s a good option to try for BED. Also have you talked with your psychiatrist about Wellbutrin? It helps with smoking cessation and is used off label sometimes for adhd and binge eating. Might be something to look into. Good luck!",

Don't single her out and don't make this about her eating disorder. Commenting on other people's eating is just a shitty thing to do in general and that's how you should frame it if you need to talk to one of your employees about this. Just be like \"hey, we don't do that here\" and leave it there.\r\n\r\nThe other thing you should do is make sure she has enough privacy at work to eat snacks without you noticing.

Hello everybody,\r\n\r\nReading some of your messages, vents and posts on here has been really heart wrenching and I'm so sorry for everyone that has to go through this, I can't begin to imagine what it must be like. \r\n\r\nPersonally, I don't have issues surrounding food and I don't want to sound insensitive so please correct me if I do at any point, but I just want some advice. My girlfriend has bulimia and I'm so grateful she can and does talk to me about her daily struggles . She's honestly one of the strongest people I know and I will never be able to fully understand what she goes through everyday. I don't want to sound selfish but I want to know if there is anything at all that I can do. I feel useless when I listen to her talk without being able to do anything to help her. I know in the end I won't be able to solve her problems for her and it will be up to her to get the help she needs. Some of you might say that my presence is enough but I also want to know what is the right way to respond to her when she talks to me about her ed. It's difficult because I don't feel what she is going through and as a result it's hard to treat and respond to her like it's something which she cannot control, even though I know she doesn't have control over the bingeing, purging and everything else. \r\n\r\nHer bingeing and purging is everyday and she is so tired of having to do it as well as the insufferable pain that results. She wants to aim for not bingeing and purging for a week but has no clue how to do that. She asked me this despite knowing I would not have an answer, she just wanted to express her difficulties. Her thought process right now is just to eat less/only eat \"healthy\" (i put quotations because her and I have different definitions of eating healthy) because she knows she won't feel bad and feel the need to purge. She believes there's more harm done to her body if she purges compared to if she just ate less... I don't know how to help her so right now I'm just here for her. \r\n\r\nTo sum it up, I'm wondering what is a good way to reply to her when she talks to me about her ed and if any of you guys have more suggestions on how she could meet her goal?",
        "answer": "I don\u2019t know how to put this, so if anyone has better phrasing or clarification please help. You have to be careful with listening to the spiral of ED thoughts.

        "question": "Someone tell me what's going on, it's been 3 days and this is terrifying. Im a 14 yo. I've been experiencing panic attacks since around the age of 11. I dont take any medication. They only happen at night, and while it takes a while, I can usually calm down from them. A few weeks ago, I had a bad one. I had a cold, and tried to take a bunch of cold medicine in the middle of the night to fall asleep. It just made me really high, and afraid i would die. That was the first time i ever woke my mom up when i was having one. 3 days ago, monday, i was in class at 10:15. I had just taken 2 ibuprofen, when suddenly I remembered the cold medicine incident, and started having a panic attack. I had to call my mom to come get me, and she brought me home. Since that, I've been going in and out of panic attacks. Three whole days. It's felt like weeks. Its the worst in the morning, then throughout the day it goes in and out, and then is bad again before bed. In morning and night, I usually get an actual panic attack (dread feelings, shaking, unable to breathe) and i cant eat anything, but after i do i sometimes feel better. And throughout the day when im not having shaking or severe flushes of the dread, panic feeling, I have a lingering feeling of it that never goes away, and i still cant breathe deeply. I havent gone back to school because im always really bad in the morning, and when i try to go back during the day, im just to scared. We went to a doctor yesterday, but they didnt do anything. Im going to my therapist tomorrow. I want to go to school. I dont want my parents to be disappointed. Both tuesday and this morning, I swear i was really trying to go to school, but i was just too afraid. Im constantly on the verge of a panic attack or crying, and it never stops. Please someone just tell me what they think is going on, or maybe even how i can stop this.",
        "answer": "Please see a doctor about it. I am a mental health nurse and also have been through the same kind of struggles myself. You\u2019re not alone. Many people go through this. Please don\u2019t let it go on without help. I don\u2019t know where you live, but every state has a mental health department. Start there. Give them a call and ask for resources.

Once I was an adult (in the US), the only thing my psychiatrist and therapist required me to do to keep seeing them was to get routine labs every few months and physicals a couple times a year. They just wanted to make sure that I was relatively healthy, and even though it was a little annoying, I think it helped me to know that too.

        "answer": "Want to clear up a misconception on this thread.\r\n\r\nConfidentiality absolutely DOES exist for minors when it comes to therapy. Unfortunately it does not apply here.\r\n\r\nThe 4 reasons a therapist can tell a minor's guardian what is said in therapy:\r\n\r\n1) you are hurting or planning to hurt yourself (EDs fall under this bc there's a very real risk of injury and death)\r\n2) you are hurting or planning to hurt someone else\r\n3) someone else is hurting you\r\n4) you give explicit permission as to what the therapist can tell your guardians.\r\n\r\nSo in this situation they can and will tell your parents, but they can't tell them general things or specifics about what is said in therapy (like if you say \"I hate my mom, she's a bitch, I'm moving out the day i turn 18\" they can't tell that information).",

        "question": "Does this qualify as an eating disorder and if so, which one? I do not restrict food or calorie intake to lose or maintain a low weight. I desperately want to gain weight. My issue is that I have zero appetite ever. I survive off coffee, water and an occasional sugary snack. When I\u2019m stressed or depressed (which feels like all the time) I can\u2019t eat anything at all. The very thought of eating makes me feel sick and when I do feel hungry I\u2019d rather feel the hunger than actually eat. Even when I\u2019m not feeling worried or depressed I just don\u2019t enjoy eating food. I don\u2019t even like the smell of it. I take a daily prescribed medication that I believe suppresses my appetite even more but I have no choice but to take it. When I do force myself to eat I feel sluggish and lethargic, and sometimes sweaty and clammy afterwards. It\u2019s very uncomfortable which is another reason I avoid eating. However, not eating makes me feel weak and sick all of the time too. I\u2019d like to know if there is a name for this specific issue so I can start looking for resources to find information for help. Seeing a therapist or nutritionist isn\u2019t an option financially right now. I would really appreciate any help anyone on this forum might be able to offer.

How often do you normally go?\r\n\r\nAlso, I have an emotional support dog who greatly assists me during periods of high anxiety or panic attacks.

My therapists have provided so much support, refused to give up on me, taught me coping skills to fight depression and anxiety and PTSD (Cognitive Behavioral Therapy and EMDR), given me a private place to express myself, taught me how to express myself, always given me objective feedback and advice on my issues, helped me keep my head above the water, helped me keep moving forward, challenged me, given me hope, inspired me, validated my struggles, shown me so much compassion, helped me think more objectively, helped me become much healthier, helped me with the grieving process, helped me be able to leave my home, and showed me that my life is worth living.\r\n\r\n>How often do you normally go?\r\n\r\nI usually go to therapy once a week, but there have been times when I've gone once every two weeks. \r\n\r\n>Does anyone have any legitimate experience with getting a certified letter from your therapist? \r\n\r\nWhile I do not have any experience with this, I know many others who have emotional support animals and service dogs. They were able to get a letter from their doctors without any issue. I think it's definitely worth asking a therapist or your doctor about getting documentation.\r\n\r\nAlso, if you've never been in therapy before and you have any questions (like what types of questions you would be asked by a professional, how to prepare for a first appointment, how first appointments usually go, or my personal experiences with professional help), then don't hesitate to ask me.

        "question": "Does anyone else get triggered by people's tone of voice? I'm not really sure how to explain this, but a few years ago I noticed that I get really triggered by the sudden changes in a person's tone of voice when they are speaking to me, even if I know they had no intention of being mean/rude.  When this happens I instantly fall into a state of depression and disassociate.  This can last anywhere from a few minutes to days. Depending on the situation, I won't be able to talk or really process what is going on in the moment. Often times when I snap out of it, I don't remember what happened right before, during and/or shortly after my disassociation. Has anyone else experienced this or know someone who has? If so, what do you find helpful in these situations? Is there anything that helps minimize your reaction/impact and snap out of your disassociated state quickly?",
        "answer": "It\u2019s totally normal to feel that way. I get triggered by my mother\u2019s tone of voice, especially when she\u2019s irritated or she\u2019s speaking loudly.

        "question": "I kind of want to just... let myself fall into a deep depression. I don't really understand it. It's heavy and comforting. That sadness that seems to come from within your chest and then wrap itself around you until you become cocooned inside it. You don't want to move, eat, go anywhere, do anything, see anyone. Lay in bed for days. Leave dishes everywhere, stay in the same clothes for days, don't answer your phone. Let your plants die, pile up dirty clothes. It sucks. But it's warm and comforting like a nostalgia from years ago, like a weighted blanket you can't keep off of you.\r\n\r\nI used to have these kinds of episodes. On smaller scales, not super long periods of time, but I was dealing with this. Since then I've spend each and every day just clawing my way out of that blanket; forcing open the cocoon. Fight to keep myself functional, as a productive human being.\r\n\r\nI can't afford to go into a depression like this. I have a job, a life. But damnit if I'm not inclined to take a week or 2 off of work so I can fall into this again.\r\n\r\nDepression sucks. Don't get me wrong. I hate being in the middle of a delicious meal and then getting hit with a pang of deep sadness so strong that I have absolutely zero appetite and have to throw that great food away. At my worst I didn't eat for days. I tried to claw myself from that blanket and I just couldn't. That strength of fight I need to keep myself afloat just wasn't there. I would make myself bowls of top ramen just to take 2 bites of it, almost vomit, and pour it out. These episodes really suck. \r\n\r\nBut they're almost addictive. I have a hard time talking about this in therapy. I say that I almost want to be depressed, and they look at me like I'm crazy. Or worse, they'd gently, almost unintelligibly, raise an eyebrow and give a soft \"huh\" before writing something down on their clipboard. I hate the clipboard. \r\n\r\nBut I can't be the only one. It reminds me of times when my problems were different. Not better or worse, but different. When I would get joy out of laying in bed at 4 am, watching tim Burton movies and cutting (as edgy as that sounds- i only did it once). It made me incredibly sad, yes, but there's a lingering happiness behind just letting all that fight go and being awash in a thick, dark, warm cloud.

If your depression has been with you for a long time, I can see how you could start to miss it when it\u2019s not there. It may not be the case that you \u2018want to be depressed\u2019 but rather that you fear you\u2019ve got something to lose, something you value? In any case I think you\u2019re not alone in feeling this way. Lots of people find themselves returning to the same problems time and time again, and I reckon it\u2019s for the same reason - they\u2019ve become attached to them purely because they\u2019re so familiar.",

        "question": "Does anyone else get anxious when they hear any type of yelling? Before I start, I want to mention that I have not been diagnosed with anxiety so far, but this is the only community where I feel like I can let this out and ask this question. (Also im new to Reddit and don\u2019t know how exactly this works, so if I do anything wrong please let me know) \r\n\r\nSo I\u2019m currently 18 years old and as for my childhood I\u2019d say it was okay. I was a pretty shy and \u2018good\u2019 kid so never got into trouble much. That\u2019s also why I can\u2019t recall ever being yelled at or hit. Maybe once, but my parent did apologise and state what they did wasn\u2019t okay so I don\u2019t think that would have affected me.\r\n\r\nHowever, I get so anxious when I hear anybody yell. It doesn\u2019t even have to be directed at me. A few examples: one of my teachers has a pretty strong, loud voice. When he suddenly calls out a student\u2019s name while I\u2019m doing my homework, I pretty much flinch even though his tone isn\u2019t even angry. \r\n\r\nOr a few weeks ago when a classmate wasn\u2019t wearing a mask, a teacher followed them into our classroom and basically yelled at them for at least a minute. While this was going on, I forced myself to just look down at my notebook and focus on anything but the yelling. Though I tried to distract myself, my eyes were teary and I felt a lump in my throat and I was really tense for the rest of that class. I think that was the most anxious I had felt in years. \r\n\r\nMy sibling who is 12 can be described as a \u2018troublemaker\u2019 I guess. They\u2019re the opposite of me which can be good at times, but it sometimes gets on my parents\u2019 nerves. They don\u2019t listen, aren\u2019t okay with being told \u201cno\u201d and pretty much do what they want when they feel like it. Because of this I often hear my parents being upset at them and I\u2019ve heard my parent yell at them a lot. Sometimes I\u2019d be in the same room, other times I\u2019d be in my room and they\u2019d be downstairs. During these times I\u2019ll also get very tense and just have a horrible feeling. If I\u2019m in the same room I won\u2019t even say a word and just get up and leave because it\u2019s too much. \r\n\r\nI have no idea what to do with this. I have an intake at a therapist next week for some mental health related issues, should I bring this up too? And does this happen to anyone else? I really don\u2019t understand why this happens to me \r\n\r\nThank you in advance for the help :)",
        "answer": "I absolutely HATE yelling. Like really, really bad. I\u2019m no sigmund freud but for me it\u2019s definitely because I grew up in an incredibly shaky household. My family was always fighting, police coming in and out of my house, just overall not fun stuff. So I\u2019m assuming that has something to do with it for me. Definitely bring this up with your therapist, perhaps they will be able to help that initial trigger, but regardless bringing up any trigger is only going to help you and your therapist work on a treatment plan. If this is your first appointment, try and spend a few minutes and just jot down the things, the moments, and the people that make you anxious. It\u2019s only going to help.

I used to practice journaling when I was younger (usually in a word doc) because I found it to be therapeutic. I also did some creative writing. Now, I struggle to record anything - either digitally or on paper (in something like a journal) - because I feel too anxious about other people finding it.

In my case it was better than real life\r\n\r\nThese days I'm starting to feel actual hate towards the internet. What is this shit? I'm just mindlessly scrolling through reddit, Facebook, Instagram and Youtube. I'm lucky if I can get myself to mindlessly play some boring game. There are still moments where I have fun, but they are rare. Maybe an hour from 11 hours doing mindless shit was actually enjoyable.\r\n\r\nEverything seems fake. Polished. Copied. Everyone wants clicks. Everyone wants to get famous for the most basic crap. Everyone wants to be positive. Anonymity? Oh please. Instagram pretty much automatically connects you with all your \"friends\". How? No idea! Clickbait everywhere. The same memes Everywhere. Everything is predictable.

Trying something radically different like that can be very refreshing for this kind of trudging through a rut mindset. \r\n\r\nThe important part is to have a goal or a few going into it. What are you going to do instead? Pick up a book instead of your phone? What if you limit digital things instead of cold turkey go without? That way you can devote time to trying new games or something. Take an online class that allows you to go at your own pace w/ limited interaction. Start a blog or journal about your experience on this journey. Tell your friends you'll be unavailable for x amount of time and you look forward to returning refreshed. Start handwritten pen pal letters with some friends and express that you want to feel more connected in the real world.\r\n\r\nIt's not hopeless, it's not the sims, it's just how the internet unfortunately developed.

Looking into behavioral therapy models like CBT, DBT, REBT might give you specific tools to unlearn some of these behaviors and automatic thoughts.\r\n\r\nI totally understand where you're coming from and recently disconnected from all social media besides Reddit myself. It's hard and I find myself staring at nothing and just zoned out a lot.

Sometimes I'll just say \"okayokayokay\" till it stops. I don't know if this is a form of self soothing or a bad habit or both? I don't know how to stop or if I need to. I feel like it makes me look crazy and I'm good at hiding it but I worry it'll accidentally slip out at work. What is wrong with me lol?",

        "question": "Does anyone else get anxiety that manifests in avoidance of enjoyable downtime activities like watching tv or reading? I get this with watching shows and reading books I haven\u2019t before, or even doing crafts. I frequently think I\u2019d like to do one of these but get anxious about it so I don\u2019t and just end up on my phone on Reddit (naturally) or watching shows I\u2019ve seen a million times. I think the anxiety might be associated with the distraction or the emotions felt when I do these things - but I feel like a freak who can\u2019t watch TV shows that everyone else watches and enjoys. Does anyone else have this issue or is it just me??\r\n\r\nEdit: thank you everyone for responding below - I honestly really felt like I was the only one in the world who felt this way. Thank you for helping me feel like I\u2019m not alone in this!",
        "answer": "Definitely! I find a lot of really small things incredibly daunting - humans have a way of wanting to remain idle and fight against change. Even if that change is a new book or tv show. \r\n\r\nIt often happens because it almost feels like work. You might feel guilty for going on Reddit, or watching the same old TV. So you project this new experience as something you *should* do and your usual habits as something you *shouldn\u2019t*. \r\n\r\nTry and reframe your thinking and tell yourself that it\u2019s OK to go on Reddit - but it\u2019s also OK if you don\u2019t want to. And it\u2019s OK to not want to read a new book, but it also could be really fulfilling (as it often is). Once you train this muscle by actually following through with new activities, it\u2019ll become like second nature. Sometimes you might \u201cfall off the wagon\u201d and return to routine, but that\u2019s perfectly ok! It\u2019s only natural. What\u2019s important is understanding that once you want to leave that routine, you\u2019re fully capable at any time. \r\n\r\nCheers :)",

Specifically those who started going through mental health struggles at a younger age, as well as those went through any form of depersonalization  \r\n\r\nI am thankfully going through recovery after many months of depression and depersonalization . A choppy recovery with many ups and downs but recovery nonetheless. However its like Ive been sick for so long I dont really know what my original personality was like. It doesnt help that all the people i know now Ive met while I was deep in the depressive episode, so everyone knows me as a quiet guy who likes to self isolate. So I dont really have ppl telling me \"oh you used to be bubbly, what happened to you now\" So figuring which of my feelings and thoughts are symptoms of depression or disassociation or anxiety and which of them are just my normal emotions is difficult. \r\n\r\nWhich is problematic because Im working on fixing my irrational responses, but how can I do that if I cant figure out which ones are irrational? If I feel irritated at someone is that just how I am or is it like repressed feelings boiling up? Am i truly an introvert who enjoys solitude or am I actively withdrawing because I am afraid of being hurt? \r\n\r\nI have had lukewarm success in dealing with this. Usually I just follow mt gut intuition that tells me, \"this is not you, you shoudnt be feeling this way\" I have several other meditation type techniques that help me with this.

I have spent months at a time (a year or so back) frantic that I \"lost my personality\". I remember writing in a journal in worry that I genuinely believed my next best move was to reiterate each element of my personality back one thing at time... whatever that meant. Anyways -- fast forward 1.5 years and I'm seeing the detrimental effect that added worry about \"who I am\" has had. Those anxious thoughts around it always felt so negative and daunting and flat out terrifying. I've (with time) given myself some grace in that its really okay to not feel super developed into myself, and that, as much as it sucks, time reveals. The ability to be slightly more lighthearted with it has reduced some of the worry and fear, which in a roundabout way allows me to feel more connected to myself. \r\n\r\n\"Am i truly an introvert who enjoys solitude or am I actively withdrawing because I am afraid of being hurt?\" FELT.",

I was rushed to the nearby emergency hospital both times and placed on IV, heart monitor, etcetera. We had financial issues in the past and my mom was always talking about how expensive medication was, how we couldn't afford it, you get it. In my situation, medication was necessary as well as therapy. I was also institutionalized three times. And ever since then i've been going to therapy and taking meds which really helped! But i feel like I don't deserve it. \r\n\r\nMaybe not \"deserve\", but I feel like I'm not worthy of getting better. \r\n\r\nI'm currently doing a project for my health class. One of the things I have to do is analyze the cost of health services - ambulance rides, emergency room costs, other things along those lines. The more I research and discover how expensive these things actually /are/, the more guilt I feel.\r\n\r\nI feel terrible. \r\n\r\nNot only did I traumatize my family, but I also costed them a LOT of money. I'm a fucking shitty person and I wish there was a way to stop existing without causing my family any pain. I'm a huge burden, both financially and emotionally. My mom is always saying she's happy I'm getting better, but I know from the hushed whispers from her conversations with her husband that I'm actually just draining their pocket. She doesn't deserve the amount of stress I'm putting her through. \r\n\r\nI'm the one that tried to kill themselves. It was my fault. Their money should be going to something better. But instead they're stuck with me, stuck paying my psychiatrist and therapy bills, stuck paying for my insurance and medication. \r\n\r\nI can't forgive myself.\r\n\r\nDoes anyone else feel the same way?\r\n\r\nedit: forgot to mention, I'm in the US if it wasn't obvious",
        "answer": "Medical care costs in the US are ridiculous. No, you should not feel guilty for getting sick and needing help. Our brains are sick, it\u2019s a disorder just like diabetes or epilepsy. You didn\u2019t choose to be sick anymore than a diabetic chooses to have an insulin crisis or an epileptic chooses to have a seizure. See how ridiculous it sounds talking about those things? Yet, we blame ourselves for mental health issues. It\u2019s good you are getting help. I\u2019ve been in and out of the hospital and treatment programs a lot in the last 5 years due to my bipolar. It\u2019s been easily over $20k out of pocket for my bills and treatments. My husband points out that he would rather I get better than lose me and to not feel bad about the medical bills. Try to focus on getting better, beating yourself up about things you can\u2019t control won\u2019t help you feel better. Be kind to yourself, you had a crisis and you got the help you needed. I\u2019ve survived several suicide attempts and I\u2019ve always felt so badly after for putting my family through that but I wasn\u2019t in my right mind. Now I know when I need more help. Make a crisis plan and ask for help before you get to the stage of suicide. Don\u2019t hold off because you\u2019re afraid of bills. Your parents would take bills any day over losing you.

I went through a really stressful event a few months ago which made my anxiety skyrocket. I have been suffering from chest pains that come and go but sometimes can last all day. It feels like a deep pain or intense burning on the left side of my chest. I\u2019ve been to numerous doctors appointments and have had ECGs, a heart echo, CBC blood test, and comprehensive metabolic panel. The doctor told me there was nothing wrong with my heart and that she would be shocked if a healthy 28 year old was having a heart attack. I am still convinced that somehow the doctor missed something. When I\u2019m in the midst of intense chest pain, it\u2019s hard to not want to go to the ER, but I can\u2019t afford to go to the ER every time the chest pain happens since it\u2019s so frequent. I would probably be there once a week.\r\n\r\nI\u2019m at a point where I\u2019m constantly anxious due to the chest pain which then is probably making the chest pain worse.

It\u2019s a never ending cycle.\r\n\r\nHow can I convince myself that I\u2019m not having a heart attack? Is it dangerous to just ignore chest pain and assume it\u2019s anxiety?

Try breathing techniques and meditation. Breathing has really helped me get some form of control over my body. What helped me the most is exercise. Running or just walking around your neighborhood is a great form to relieve stress and anxiety. Distractions and hobbies will be your best friend. Its okay!

All at once too. I will go months alone and crave social interaction and then when I finally have it, I drop it. And the whole time i\u2019m not replying, I feel guilt and anger that I am doing it.

Then have a distraction planned after eating like playing a game, doing a puzzle, talking to a friend, reading, going for a walk, listen to music etc. Distraction can be really helpful when we are dealing with heightened anxiety after eating.\r\n\r\nFinally, set an intention around this food. You can say something to yourself like, \"My intention is to eat this bar and not purge.\" or \"I can trust myself around this food.\" Imagine exactly how you want your interaction with this food to play out. Imagine yourself eating the amount that you want and not engaging in eating disorder behaviors afterwards.

I have an AMAZING dietitian who I really trust and who keeps me wanting to pursue recovery even though I'm struggling. What makes this dietitian so great is that she explains the science behind why we need to eat and what our bodies do with the nutrients and how bulimia affects our bodies. She also counsels me around my behaviours and we look at strategies for managing them. Lastly, she prescribes me a meal plan but we work together to make it with foods I like eating so that it works for me and my lifestyle. \r\n\r\nI think getting a good psychologist as well can be really helpful too. The dietitian will counsel you but they can't do what a therapist can in terms of looking at deep seated emotional issues and ways of thinking, doing and being. \r\n\r\nI'd also recommend finding a good GP who can look after the medical side of things and co-ordinate your care between providers.\r\n\r\nGood luck with your journey, I hope you can build a great team around you to support your recovery.",

I was feeling okay and also I lose some kilograms. After a week of eating outside with friends and a kinda stressful week I started overeating. I didn't feel that guilty. I overate Tuesday and binged yesterday. I had therapy Tuesday, and my therapist told me that she thinks I am having a hard time accepting my progress that I am better that I am look bcs i don't have that emotional response to overate or binging anymore. And actually I am not binging I am just overeating. And congratulated me for my progress. that felt nice, the next day (yesterday) was going so well and in the night after a good dinner I ate an orange, a bunch of Oreos, potatoes, fried cheese and chicken and like 6 peaches. while the binge was happening I feel so sick like I was just eating bcs i want to prove that I am still sick.

So, I have a few questions:\r\n\r\n\\- for the adult bulimics, when did you develop your disorder? \r\n\r\n\\- Which is more harmful, binging and not purging or pbing?\r\n\r\n\\- And for everybody, what are some tips to not binge (and obviously purge)?!\r\n\r\nThanks!",

But at about 15 I started to really control my weight by strict dieting...which led to bulimia. (I could have my cake and eat it too).\r\nI spent about 20 years (20 YEARS!) in that particular hell, and it defined my life really, in terms of the aborted hopes and dreams, and the limitations of the work I could do.\r\nI am so grateful to have my life back and I hope you manage to find some hope, and something that works.\r\nThere is no magic bullet, but a browse through some of the posts in this subreddit might give you some ideas.

        "answer": "Only 2 months, no history of bulimia before that? It sounds like you are weakening the \"valve\" that keeps stuff in your stomach, which happens when the gag reflex is over-used (ie very common for people with bulimia). That allows acid to come back up, and can lead to \"involuntary regurgitation\" (throwing up \"in your mouth all day\"). With no history, 2 months seems too short to develop an ulcer, unless maybe you are adult age or have some pre-disposition to it.",

I feel so alone in this and need help with getting out of it. \r\n\r\nMy ED story:  \r\n\r\nI (F23) developed disordered eating styles due to growing up with CPTSD. For most of my life I have been obese. I've lost all the (over)weight three times. It was at its worst in 2018 right before I finished highschool. I developed heart palpitations and had to see doctors because of severe hip pain; they thought I had osteoporosis, luckily I didn't, but that was a wake up call for me. I made myself go inpatient in 2019, miraculously got pregnant after getting out and gained more than double my weight after that. I ate because I was so scared my body couldn't keep up with being pregnant. Then I ate and ate because I was emotionally overwhelmed and had a  baby. Now I'm at my highest weight ever, active, but I keep overeating and I feel stuck in this loop. Whenever I try to lose weight i swing into anorexic habits. I've tried just focusing on being healthy and active which helps with depression but I can not stop emotional eating when I'm anxious. And i am anxious 90% of the time. \r\n\r\nI hate my body so much and am having a hard time existing. I'm seeing 3 therapists, but I am scared of talking about food issues as it holds a lot of shame. We have scratched the surface and I hope to find the courage to talk about it. For now I hope I can maybe catch some words on here from people who might get it. \r\nOften I feel too gross to even leave the house, which used to be my downfall. Now, having a kid, that is not a thought I am allowing myself to indulge in. As soon as she sleeps it bursts out though. My relationship is definitely taking a physical blow because of it and I'm scared of what will happen when my child picks up on it. I just don't know how to stop this disorder.",

What you're going through is normal for the condition you've got and your therapist will likely have the tools to help you manage it.   \r\n\r\n\r\nJust remember, yes its scary coming back to this place, but you're not the same person you were years ago. You're so much better equipped to deal with what's going on, and I can say that definitively without even knowing you because you've already recovered once.   \r\n\r\n\r\nIf you've already recovered once, you can do it again.

When I lapsed years ago (it was a bad lapse though, I was on the verge of recovery) I didn't want to return to therapy or my protective strategies because they represented a time for me that I wanted to leave in the past. But I'm glad I did, because it was a stepping stone to me being recovered as I write this.   \r\n\r\n\r\nOne day, I know I will probably relapse too.

I just got it the other day and it half filled the first day and over the last 2 theres been like nothing. I dont have a scale or get weight checked so i have no idea about any loss of weight but i just wanted to know if this happened to anyone in this context.",
        "answer": "Yes, this is common with restrictive eating because your body isn\u2019t getting enough nutrients. It\u2019s shutting down your reproductive system first so it can divert that energy to more essential systems to keep you alive \r\n\r\nAlthough, if you just moved in with LD BF, I\u2019d guess it\u2019d be good to take a test just to be safe",

I want to stop soo bad. \r\n\r\nI\u2019m 5.1, at June I weighed 92 Ibs, know I weigh 101 and my ideal weight would be 88.  I want to loose weight, I need to but I can\u2019t stop thinking about food and eating it. \r\n\r\nI\u2019m trying to restrict but I always fail, I feel so bad about myself, I want to became anorexic right now.\r\n\r\nDo you guys have any tips?",
        "answer": "If you want to stop, you\u2019ve come to the right place. This is a pro-recovery r/ after all. These are tips for reassessing your relationship with food, and putting some things into context. \r\n\r\nThat said, let\u2019s put the behaviors into perspective: your body is starving. Starving is not just physical, it\u2019s mental and psychological. When people restrict, the body goes into survival mode, it conserves resources, it clings to any and all nutrition it gets because it believes that it will never see food again. \r\nOnto the mental side, your brain is also an organ that is starving. The \u201cdesperation\u201d and lack of control come from intense hunger. The body knows what it needs. I\u2019m not going to comment on the numbers revolving around your weight, but ~6 months of starvation would inevitably lead to the brain psychologically changing and altering in order to try and save itself. \r\n\r\nI used to restrict all day and end up \u201cbinging\u201d at night. That was my body screaming for help. That was my brain begging me for nourishment. For fuel.\r\n\r\nThe most difficult step towards recovery I took was realizing I couldn\u2019t trust myself to do it alone. I couldn\u2019t trust my altered brain chemistry, my eating disorder, to allow me to recovery. I sought professional help, but I know how difficult it is to actually\u2026 do that. Let\u2019s talk small steps. No particular order, just general tips to harm reduce and start the path to recovery. These are not \u201ctips to lose weight.\u201d This is about restoring a healthy relationship with food.\r\n\r\n- Eat something consistently. Utter restriction leads to compensation, start just eating *something* every couple of hours. Not just one big meal, not just nothing. Something consistently. You can worry about full nutrition later. Just eat something. \r\n\r\n- Meals with friends. Company I find makes mealtime easier. I\u2019m more inclined to enjoy the food- to make a positive experience and connection with food- if I\u2019m eating with people. You deserve positivity. Eating somewhere with a friend or a loved one makes a world of a difference. \r\n\r\n- Separate your thinking as your Eating Disorder. This is a simple way of thinking that can help shift perspective. Look, you\u2019ve got this ED on your back running the show. Separating the you from the behaviors and relationship with food, even the negative comments on your body as your Eating Disorder trying to take you over\u2026 I dunno. It helped me a lot.\r\n\r\n- Write down things you want to do- you need a body to get you there. You need to nourish that body to do it. Sometimes deep in my ED its hard for me to know what I want to do, but if I want to walk around, write my novel, dive into my hobbies- I can\u2019t do that starved and weak, clinging to my ED. I find it a helpful reframe in my priorities.\r\n\r\n- Stop counting calories. Is it easy to? No. I don\u2019t live in the US currently so the nutrition labels are a lot more discrete. Back home I\u2019d slap a post it over them.  This takes time, I still try to roughly estimate in my head- but it\u2019s better than full on counting. \r\n\r\n- Throw out your scale. This is big- but man. I have no idea what I weigh. It\u2019s awesome. I don\u2019t have tips for this, I simply moved somewhere without a scale, but it made a world of a difference. \r\n\r\n- Reach out to others, which you\u2019ve done! I think that\u2019s pretty damn cool, it shows that a part of you separate from your ED wants out. Life doesn\u2019t have to be like this, friend. \r\n\r\n- Think about seeking professional help (if you are able to.) Any support is better than none. There are free support groups online available, you don\u2019t even have to participate, you just have to show up. It makes a difference hearing other people\u2019s stories.\r\n\r\nThis isn\u2019t a comprehensive list, but it\u2019s a start. I\u2019m so glad you reached out. I\u2019m glad you\u2019re here. I can\u2019t take private messages for my own health and safety, but know I\u2019m cheering you on and I\u2019m so proud of you for being here today.",

Here are a few things I've learned:\r\n\r\nIf I've been undereating, my stomach looses \"stretchiness\". I don't know exactly what's going on, but there's definitely a vicious cycle involved.\r\n\r\nWhen recovering from a relapse, it's not unusual for me to need to start with smaller more frequent meals, and work my way up to larger less frequent meals.\r\n\r\nI've also found it helpful to make sure I'm eating plenty of natural flavorful fats - not so much bland fats like canola oil.\r\n\r\nNo restrictions on saturated fat or cholesterol, I feel worse if I rely too heavy on \"healthy\" unsaturated fats like olive oil, even though I think olive oil is great and use it occasionally.\r\n\r\nWhen I eat plenty of natural flavorful fats like fatty meats and fish, butter, coconut milk, avocado, etc, it literally lubricates the food and makes it go down easier, it makes the food more satiating in a way the motivates me to eat more - but never motivates me to eat beyond what's physically comfortable.\r\n\r\nThe food tastes better, it sits better in my stomach, I'm satiated longer, and fat is calorically dense.\r\n\r\nA lot of people with EDs are scared of fats, especially saturated fats, and animal fats.

Your partner is going to have to choose to get help on her own. You can be there, and tell her your concern (I wholly agree with the comments above) but ultimately she has to decide not just to seek help, but to accept it. (In my experience those are two different things, and equally hard to do.)\r\n\r\nBe there, be present, remind her you care about her and want her to experience live with you in the moment. If she doesn\u2019t open up or she refuses to realize her condition- that\u2019s all you can do besides raising concern with others to intervene if she doesn\u2019t herself. EDs come with serious health risks. The fact she\u2019s telling you these issues with food are in itself a cry for help, so I don\u2019t doubt that she\u2019s noticing these changes, but it is scary to be seen as needing help. \r\nYou\u2019re doing the right thing, but you can\u2019t make her choose recovery or treatment (though you can lead her there with family and her support system if necessary) she has to make that call on her own. \r\n\r\nIt\u2019s hard, I know.

        "question": "What are some healthy ways to prevent \u2018binge eating\u2019? Disclaimer: I\u2019m not bulimic, anorexic, or over/underweight. However, I have some stomach conditions (chronic gastritis, peptic ulcer disease) that make me sensitive to food. I get extremely hungry sometimes and I eat to the point where I feel sick. The intense urge for me to eat like this is fairly common. I believe I am guilty of \u2018binge eating\u2019. I don\u2019t vomit, but I experience serious nausea. I almost feel like I can\u2019t help it because the desire to eat for me feels like a primal urge yet my conditions and possibly binge eating make me feel sick.\r\n\r\nMy current plan is as follows:\r\n- Portion control. Have the portion of food I\u2019m going to eat prepared.\r\n- High fiber, high protein diet, low carbs, low sugar to encourage longer satiation.\r\n- Time the distance between meals.\r\n\r\nAny other ideas?",
        "answer": "Being very strict about macros, rules, etc can actually trigger more binging, so I would be careful with anything like that. \r\n\r\nIt sounds like the high hunger level is a trigger for you. It might be helpful to keep lots of snacks around that are easy on your stomach to avoid getting extremely hungry. Try tuning in to your hunger signals as much as you can (timed meals as mentioned in another comment can help with noticing earlier hunger signals). Even thinking about food is an early sign of hunger. \r\n\r\nBinging is typically a response to restricting. So the extreme hunger triggering a binge makes sense. Something else that doesn\u2019t get talked about too often is that mentally restricting (thoughts like \u201cI can\u2019t eat this\u201d or \u201cI shouldn\u2019t be eating this\u201d) can actually trigger binge behaviors as well. This can be difficult if you have stomach conditions! (I have IBS and no longer have my gallbladder so I can relate!)\r\nSometimes shifting my mindset toward trigger foods can make a difference for binge behaviors. Choosing between \u201cam I prepared for the discomfort of eating this right now?\u201d can help instead of outright telling myself something is totally off limits. \r\n\r\nHope some of this helps!",

I think I'll always be struggling with my mental health and burnout, and even though I've been a high achiever all my life all I want is an easy job that pays the bills but doesn't exacerbate my depression, where I can spend my free time just doing things I enjoy.

        "question": "I just recently started purging\u2026. Idk what to do The purging started because of a near death experience I had involving a food allergy I didn\u2019t know I had, and I ended up having to be hospitalized for two days because of a reaction that I had to this food. An allergic reaction to be very specific, I went into severe anaphylaxis and quite literally could not breathe nor form words whilst in the hospital for the first 5-8 hours I was there. I had to get over three rounds of epinephrine, (basically adrenaline) used for anaphylactic shock, which is an abnormal amount for an allergic reaction. Since then (happened about 2 months ago) I have had intense panic attacks anytime I eat anything other than mac and cheese. And I\u2019ve never had panic attacks before, it\u2019s been such a new experience and an extremely frightening one at that. I was prescribed a benzodiazepine to assist with the physical effects of the panic attacks, but the mental panic is unwavered by these drugs and the physical symptoms have not reduced noticeably. I have yet to been prescribed something else in order to combat these mental issues relating to the panic. I\u2019m 23 y/o and have never dealt with something so incredibly intense, at least that I remember. The purging started shortly after this event, within the first two weeks. Anytime I ate anything (even mac and cheese) I felt the need to get it out of my system. Even though I knew from an allergist perspective that it would not assist in preventing an allergic reaction from whatever food I had eaten, and yet I find it hard to stop. I\u2019ve begun drinking alcohol on a regular basis which assists in my purging. I buy food and basically binge eat until I have a panic attack which causes me to then purge whatever I have eaten. I really don\u2019t know where to go from here and have not had the chance to speak about this to the therapist I have been seeing since the event since the focus of our sessions is the panic relating to food. Idk what to do at this point, I feel so lost. I\u2019ve never felt the need to purge before but now it seems as if it\u2019s the only option.",
        "answer": "Please talk to a therapist about this. Someone with good experience treating eating disorders. \r\n\r\nThis is a lot more common than people realize. Purging isn\u2019t always related to the desire to be thin. \r\n\r\nThings are super scary right now, and you deserve the mental health support that you need to keep yourself safe and healthy.

        "question": "hungrier after binging than when I was restricting hopefully, this isn't triggering, I just need advice\r\nI know that if you binge after restricting for a bit, it can jumpstart your metabolism. I've restricted very heavy for about two days and then binged the last two nights, and I feel even hungrier than when I was restricting :( any idea why?",
        "answer": "First: don\u2019t be too freaked out. This is super common. You\u2019re not alone. There\u2019s nothing wrong with you and this is NOT a sign to go back to heavily restricting (it will just keep the cycle going)\r\nSecond: there are a lot of things that can be going on. Your metabolism can temporarily be raised to deal with the higher input of food. Your body could also be screaming for more after having been restricted so long.\r\nI heard a great analogy for binging:\r\nIt\u2019s like holding your breath. Breathing is so natural, so necessary. Holding your breath (restricting) can only go on for so long before you NEED to breathe. And you don\u2019t just breathe, you gasp for breath after holding it for so long (the binge). You might still be gasping. Still needing to take in more.\r\n\r\nBottom line: your body is trying to get what it needs right now. It\u2019s not against you or malicious, it\u2019s crying for something - more food",

I am a depress!on , eating disorder and su!c!de survivor for about a year I never felt this happy and free my entire life tho I am still struggling with anxiety and overthinking.\r\n  On to the story , I am a freshman in highschool and meet M on the hallways , he is 1 grade older than me , BC we are having our classes next to eachother we started talking , for the first or second mouth we just had lil conversation now and then BC I don't usually stay in my classroom cause' my classmates are being to laud , our intercalation were pleasant and just right, he didn't care about my \" style\" and I kinda started to have a hallway crush on him . 2 months ago we started talking more and we exchanged Instagram accounts and started talking some more , we had 2 dates and then he asked me to be his gf over the text ( I never had the hearth to tell him about my gender BC I was scared of what he would say ) I was taken by surprise and didn't know what to do so I just said yes and went on with it . He is a very sweet and caring man and I am Shure that any girl that he would meet he would make her happy like he does it to me , he give me flowers and takes me on dates but for a while I don't feel that happiness anymore. Yes I love him and when he is with me I am happy but when I'm not around him I get extremely anxious and overthink everything, I don't know what to do and it started about 1 week after we started dating . I started to have nightmares , siting in the shower and overthink ( habit that I got rid of with my depression) , barely eat and constantly anxiously checking my phone to see if he texted and to know that I didn't do something wrong or just didn't reply at a text from him . \r\n  I thought of braking up with him but I know that everyone will say that I lead him on and will lose a lot of friends if I do so plus I don't wanna hurt him , he is a great , romantic, sweet and well mannered man that knows how to treat a woman but in the same time I didn't felt so miserable sience 1 year ago .\r\n  Idk what to do , I am the bad person and should suck it up and be happy with this man ? Any advice would help me so much, tky for reading I just really needed to take this off my chest BC I don't have someone that I fully trust to talk to .",
        "answer": "It seems you have an anxious attachment style. Attachment types are formed in childhood and directly impact how you interact in relationships. Without going into it too much right now, I can assure you are definitely not a bad person. I also used to be an anxious attachment type and felt all the things you listed \u2026. Feeling anxious when my partner wasn\u2019t around, checking my phone if he texted. The root of it is usually subconscious fear of loss. I felt like I wanted to break up with my partner too because it was so overwhelming. I started therapy and this is where I learnt about my anxious attachment style. If you have the resources available, I would definitely recommend therapy. It really helped my process my relationship anxiety and separation anxiety. If you don\u2019t have the resources available, simply google it and learn some tips on steps you can take to slowly become more secure. \r\n\r\nYou are worthy of the love you are receiving from him!!! You say he is great, sweet, romantic and well mannered. That is amazing!!! I know it feels scary when he leaves but remember he is totally into you! I learnt about things I can ask from my partner that helped ease the separation anxiety. Such as checking in, or simple reassurance went a long way. \r\n\r\nAgain, there is nothing wrong with you and you are not a bad person. Your attachment is simply activated. Once you have awareness, it helps because you can understand what is happening and why. \r\n\r\nWishing you lots of luck!! You got this!",

        "answer": "I'm gonna be real with you: being put in a psych ward against my will at 16 was slightly traumatic. BUT it was because of my personal circumstances. I was there for one week and I live in Hungary so I have limited experience and knowledge about what you're might be getting into but here's what I know nonetheless. I hope it helps. \r\n\r\nFirst of all I was already going to therapy and had a developing support system that I was taken out of. You on the other hand don't seem to have a stable support system at all and would probably benefit from the attention of professionals and people with similar issues (aka you could even make some friends although in my experience it is a hit or miss. But you will definitely benefit from hearing similar stories from people in similar but just different enough situations, trust me). ***If you feel like you need help you're probably right.*** Getting away from your parents, whatever the exact situation might be would also seem like a good idea based on what you wrote. ***In sum I definitely recommend talking to a therapist and it might even be beneficial for you to go to hospital*** although that depends on the hospital itself. Also you should definitely ask your therapist about being hospitalised, especially if you're afraid to be open because of the uncertainties surrounding it. They will have better answers suited for you than any of us here on reddit. \r\n\r\nI'm not sure about your local place's rules but in my experience and what I heard in other places as well they take your phone away. We had one hour daily to use our phones, which overlapped with the one hour that visitors were allowed so I practically couldn't use it at all because parents always bugged me to pay attention to them lol. Entertainment wise they provided a lot of things, from art supplies through TV to guided activities and even played with us if none of the other patients were willing so I didn't miss social media but I did miss being able to communicate with my friends.\r\n\r\nIf you get put in a hospital ***your legal guardian will know about it.*** I'm not sure if you can prevent them from visiting you as I never had an issue like that but you should talk about a doctor with it. I'm sure you're not the first one who would have an issue like that (if you even want to prevent them. That's just the vibe I got from your post). ***They will also most likely see the reports that the doctors write about you***, which can be very scary, I know. In my experience it doesn't contain very specific things, just general statements. For me these reports (or at least the parts in laymans terms) were 3-4 short paragraphs long where at least one would be taken up by my background (how old I was, what my hobbies were, where I went to school, etc). This was in every report, I assume, for the purpose of informing any other doctor or therapist that might take my case about the basic info needed about me. A report like this was produced after every one-on-one talk, sometimes including psychological tests. The 2nd-3rd paragraphs were taken up by the contents of these talks and tests, again, general tastements, almost bulletpoints about the most important things. The last paragraph would talk about diagnoses, suspected and outruled problems. ***So don't be scared because of this. Having your parents know about stuff is a necessary sacrifice for the betterment of yourself.*** This is also something I had to come to terms with and was very uncomfortable at first. But you have to understand that this is a \"necessary evil\" for things to get better.\r\n\r\n***GOING TO HOSPITAL  WILL NOT RUIN YOUR LIFE*** */in most cases\r\nUnless you get sent to a *very* bad mental hospital that worsens your condition, you will not really lose from this. For the duration of your stay there you will probably not go to school, unless they let you go online, however a lot of the time it's an important point to let people there take a rest from school or work. If that means missing an exam based on how severe your situation is they might just say that you'll have to take it next year. But trust me, they know what they're doing. If they say you need to miss the exam, you're probably better off missing that exam >!than killing yourself over it if you get what I'm saying!<\r\n\r\nRecord of you being there will of course be in your medical records and your GP will probably know about it. I think there are aa few diagnoses and medicines that would prevent you from driving a car for example or if you are very violent they might prevent you from becoming a teacher and prohibit you from getting a firearm. But these are ***extreme cases*** and >!unless you killed or raped someone!< getting a diagnoses will not have any serious negative effects. On the contrary it will greatly help you, your caregivers and your doctors in understanding your problem and its possible solutions so don't shy away from it. \r\n\r\nAlso, I'm not a lawyer but to my knowledge you have zero obligation to disclose your medical history to your regular ol' job provider unless it's relevant to the actual work. If anything this will only help you with overcoming your issues and being more balanced in the future - aka having a better life. ***I can't stress this enough. If you feel like you need help, get help! It will most likely actually help!***\r\n\r\nThroughout this comment I talked about ***inpatient treatment*** aka: you sleep there, eat there, shower there and can't leave unless they let you. Based on your specific circumstances you might be put in ***outpatient care.*** We had one outpatient girl who slept and showered at home. However from ~8-16 (I don't remember the exact time but for the majority of the day) she was mandated to be there in the hospital and follow the same rules as us aka: not leave without supervision unless allowed and follow the activities of the group. She ate with us, etc. but would go home at the end of the day. Whether you go inpatient or outpatient is based on some factors: First and foremost how much of a threat are you to yourself and/or others and how safe are you at home? If you are eligible for both inpatient and outpatient and the hospital has the capacity (aka: enough beds, food, caretakers, etc) they might let you choose what you prefer. After they let me out they said they'd welcome me if I wanted to continue this in outpatient care.\r\n\r\nLast addendum: I saw a lot of people comment bad things about mental health care in the states. I have no experience with that and hearing about the absolute state of american health care saddens me greatly. I might be a bit too optimistic because I had - regardless of some traumas - actual positive experiences with therapists and the hospital I was in. But that's Hungary. Please, ***please*** ask a local professional - either a therapist or your GP - about your situation before getting into all of this! I'm not even sure if you're in the states - regardless, ***ask someone local about this who know their stuff!!! ***\r\n\r\nI hope at least you get some idea about mental hospitals from this! And I really wish for your situation to get better <3 if you have any questions you can also just message me if you'd like, I'll answer everything I can(although I might not be the most experienced) I remember how scary it was not knowing anything that went on.",

She is basically a little sister to me and I love her so much. \r\n\r\nI see her mainly during school breaks. With each school break she visits I can see her anxiety getting worse. \r\n\r\nShe has panic attacks that cause her not to be able to speak. She wants to talk to people but she just can\u2019t. Her heart rate is really high for someone her age (140 at rest) and I\u2019m guessing that is due to her anxiety.

        "answer": "Statistics from the UK's Nat. Inst. for Clinical Evidence: although this is not as effective as seeing a therapist, many people suffering from anxiety benefit from self-help. In recent years, evidence for therapeutic breathing has been very encouraging.\r  \r\n\r  \r\nThe self-help I'm describing here is not complicated.  \r  \r\n\r  \r\nWhen we have a lot of anxiety, it puts worrisome thoughts into our heads. There's two ways to get rid of those thoughts.\r  \r\n \r  \r\nOne is just to calm down. The easiest way to do this is to breathe slowly till you feel OK. Two psychiatrists, Brown and Gerbarg, say a 10 or 20 min slow breathing exercise is good and 20 min twice a day is a therapy for anxiety. The exercise is inhale and exhale gently, 6 seconds each.\r  \r\n\r  \r\nWhen you're calm, you can think your way through a problem instead of just worrying about it. Think about the worst thing that can happen, how likely that is and what you could do if it happens. In a stressful situation, think about the different ways you can respond and decide which one is the most intelligent.\r  \r\n \r  \r\nDon't make mountains out of molehills.\r  \r\n \r  \r\nWhen you use the thinking brain, you get control of the emotional brain, and you feel better.\r  \r\n \r  \r\nAlso, replace negative thoughts with positive thoughts. Count your blessings and remind yourself of your successes.\r  \r\n\r  \r\nThe treatments for anxiety range from simple stress reduction methods to therapy and medication.\r  \r\n\r  \r\nDon't overlook stress management - it can help even with very bad anxiety.\r  \r\n \r  \r\nVideo - a lot of helpful information, including the 3-part program of Brown and Gerbarg -\r  \r\n\r  \r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqEM\\_jlDRZI\r  \r\n\r  \r\n  Freedom from Self-Harm: Overcoming Self-Injury with Skills from DBT and Other Treatments \r  \r\n\r  \r\nThis book has been endorsed by Marsha Linehan, who created DBT, the best treatment for borderline personality disorder, which has serious self-injury as a frequent symptom. \r  \r\n\r  \r\nThere's a wide variety of treatments. Very severe cases require months of intense therapy but many people do well with a treatment that's just a booklet and a few therapy sessions, usually 2 or 3. \r  \r\n\r  \r\nTreatments that only reduce self-harm are considered successful. The less you self-harm the stronger you are and better able to deal with the problems that led to your self-harm.  Likewise, the better you are in dealing with the underlying problems the more it reduces the self-harm.",

What I'm trying to find out is why suicide implies something bad for the person who commits it, leaving aside that we know the basics, like for example that they shouldn't do it because there is a solution and all that.\r\n But what I see is that the consequences only cover what their close social circle feels, despite this it is not clear to me why people are so against it, and I also don't understand the messages of all the campaigns out there, I would like to see other points of view to understand.",
        "answer": "low effort reply but: suicide must be largely frowned upon by the collective, partially because suicide being perceived as a bad thing leads to fewer people initially considering it. if suicide is neutral, it becomes more normalized, and thus becomes a more accessible point of consideration for some people. a lot of people who kill themselves would have gotten better if they had not. \r\n\r\nalso, most suicides are ultimately a product of material conditions. scores of people who are struggling (money, healthcare, addiction, employment) should not just disappear - they should be noticed, and their recoveries should be supported via structural change. when society/government fails to help individuals thrive, this collective pain should serve as a call to action. if people can simply kill themselves and this *isn\u2019t* an inherently bad thing, then there is far less reason to demand that material conditions improve for everyone.",

My stomach doesn't hurt and doesn't feel full, and my mouth craves chewing on something so bad its physically painful. \r\n\r\nI just ate a lot of food, I've eaten most of the food iv'e just bought and I went shopping yesterday. Is this my body making up for the weight I lost when I had no money for groceries? Its always like this, when I have no food in my house I dont feel hungry at all and can survive of two bags of chips and nothing else each day, when I have food in the house I physically cannot stop eating or feeling hungry. I dont even know if this would count as an eating disorder because I litteraly have no money to buy food most of the time, no food to eat means I starve myself, not because I want to, but because I have to. Will I develop an eating disorder when I am finacially stable and have food at my disposable?",
        "answer": "it's probably that you just have been suppressing/ignoring your hunger cues so much you can't tell which ones tell you you're full. I would say try to eat slower and be more mindful of every bite if you want to feel full.",

        "answer": "Ive been recovering from an ed for almost a year now and i struggled with things like this too. While its certainly hard to break a cycle once its started, especially with things like OCD (or ADHD in my case) it helps so much to just not think about it.  Try sitting down with a meal and ignore the fact that youre eating at all. Put all your thought into the news, a show, or talk to a friend while eating. Try to remember that food is fuel. Without fuel, you start enjoying your life less and less. When you dont think about food 24/7, your brain has so much more space to think about everything amazing in life. \r\nAs for struggling with body image, it took me forever to get used to gaining weight. But at a point, your body resets itself. If youre fueling yourself properly, you body should maintain a healthy weight on its own. You shouldnt keep gaining weight until you could be on 1000 pound sisters lol. I found that looking at yourself in a mirror and only thinking good things about yourself helped me. I think it was important in my  recovery to remeber how much time im wasting worrying about a body i should be grateful to have. Idk if this was helpful at all, but i wish you luck on your recovery.

        "answer": "Any therapists, dieticians, programs educated in ED will know that anorexia exists in all sizes.   When I first went to residential I was considered overweight still, however my organs had failed due to anorexia because I went from obese to overweight quickly.   Any further and I likely would not be typing this.   That was 5 years ago.   \r\n\r\nI started an intense outpatient treatment recently due to a relapse.   I asked for help much earlier this time due to a fear of organ failure again.  I am back to being plus size. \r\n\r\nMy experience has been that no provider that actually treats and is knowledgeable on EDs has ever treated me poorly or suggested that I don't have anorexia.   I was welcomed the same as straight sized people and those under weight.   Our treatment paths were the same regardless of our sizes.   \r\n\r\nAs a friend you can only do so much, your friend has to want help.   Please continue to be their support.   Research ED treatment in your area. Look up atypical anorexia and share your knowledge with them.   Don't ever sweep the anorexia under the rug and pretend it isn't there.   You may eventually tire of saying or attempting them to eat, your relationship may suffer...just keep being there, letting them know they and their health are important to you.  Eating disorders are a complex mental illness that also is rooted in biology, culture, etc.   It is difficult to unpack it all.   I strongly recommend having professional help.   It saved my life.",

I have OCD, and I guess depression or dysthymia, as well as a lot of self hatred.\r\n\r\nI don't purge regularly, however I have in the past and I did tonight. So really quickly over the past year or so, give or take, sometimes I've eaten a lot of food and then felt uncomfortably full, so to make myself feel better, not like to feel better about myself for eating to much, but to feel not stuffed I've made myself throw up. \r\n\r\nOne time I ate too much cheese on bread and after, I made myself throw up because I felt too full. A little differently at my brother's wedding I drank too much and felt woozy and a little full so I went to the bathroom and made myself throw up. Today I didn't eat all day, except for potato chips, and then at like 11 PM or so I had two veggie burgers and two impossible burgers with bread and mayo, I was feeling pretty full when I was almost done eating, but I pushed myself and finished the food. I went up to my room and felt kind of uncomfortable so I went to my basement and started making myself throw up. I had tears coming out of my eyes, from throwing up, not crying.\r\n\r\nThis time was kind of different from the rest because I made myself \"finish the job\", meaning I didn't stop until I felt like I had thrown up everything. When I was done I went to the sink and spit out and there was blood in my spit and my throat hurts when I swallow.\r\n\r\nIs this bulimia or just something that can become bulimia if not addressed.",
        "answer": "This is definitely bulimic behavior. I don\u2019t know whether you meet the DSM-V criteria for Bulimia or not, but if you don\u2019t currently, and don\u2019t get help, I very much believe you will soon. You are here asking this question for a reason. Talk to your therapist. Some of us feel more consciously \u201cin control\u201d of our actions at the beginning of an ED than others. In my case I was aware that what I was doing was considered \u201cdisordered\u201d, but I thought because I was aware of that and was \u201cin control\u201d of it, that I didn\u2019t have an eating disorder. It\u2019s amazing the amount of denial that can go on. I was actually sitting across from my therapist, who was an ED specialist, when it occurred to me that I actually might be Bulimic. I\u2019d been purging, bingeing, starving for 4 years at that point, and had asked for a therapist who understood EDs, because I related to the perfectionism that people with them had, but I didn\u2019t truly get that I, personally, had an eating disorder until I\u2019d been seeing her for probably 6 months.

Although it\u2019s easier said than done, I would hate for her relationship with food to worsen. \r\n\r\nAs i said, ive battled with my relationship with food for a long time. Ive developed lifelong heart issues, my menstrual cycle stopped, ive been hospitalized multiple times, i have stomach & digestive issues, my metabolism will take years to fix, and so many other things\u2014 that is the unfortunate and ugly truth of anorexia. Anorexia is serious and it\u2019s good to get help before her physical AND mental health quickly starts to decline, because it surely will (if it hasn\u2019t already) if her bad eating habits continue.\r\nAs long as you make her feel loved and supported, you are doing enough. \r\n\r\nI wish you both the best and i hope your partner can recover safely. :)",

On a scale of 1-10 with 10 being the worst, i\u2019d say it\u2019s a 7. The causes are loneliness (attachment issues), fear of rejection, and lack of confidence (voice, short attention span, lack of discipline, feeling behind for my age). I don\u2019t have many friends. I enjoy doing things like blogging, hanging out with people, discussing controversial topics, working out, and watching movies. however, i don\u2019t do these things often because depression makes me lazy. the only thing ive been doing consistently is going to the gym (2-3 times a week). it feels nice but doesn\u2019t help with depression. \r\n\r\ni know i\u2019m capable of so much but i\u2019m also really hard on myself whenever i mess up. i care so much about what other people think of me. \r\n\r\nSometimes, i don\u2019t feel depressed, especially when talking to family or friends, but that\u2019s probably because i\u2019m suppressing it.

Started learning Python, applied to public university, which is free, for a second graduation and was approved. I'm currently enrolled in an IT course in uni.\r\n\r\nI also started streaming to try a little income. It's a great experience and I love doing it, but it is very tiring.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile my wife was getting her salary and paying our bills, but this year she's been cut from her research until April, which means she'll only get paid in May. That never happened before and is the result of the incompetent and malicious administration of the former government.\r\n\r\nI do have a few freelance things I'm working on, in Python, but not enough to sustain us. But we also have some money in reserve, so it will be harsh but if everything goes ok, we'll survive.\r\n\r\nI'm still looking for a job, but now I have do dedicate a lot of time to uni and to learning.\r\n\r\nAlso I have a health problem that makes me sick in semi random intervals of time, around one or two times a month. When that happens, I may or may not start throwing up. That destroyed my confidence to look for presencial work, I'm focusing on remote job hunting because there's no way to know when I'll not be feeling well.\r\n\r\nThis health problem should have been treated already, but due to bureaucracy and some management errors, my treatment stopped.

She is a wonderful young person and the light of my life. For the last few years, she has been struggling openly with anxiety and depression. I have taken her to a few psychiatrists and she also sees a talk therapist regularly. She\u2019s been so far on only a few different SSRIs and is now on Zoloft, which seems to be working just a little bit better for her than other meds. Over the past year, her mental health has gotten even worse though and she\u2019s been quite vocal to me about her feelings of helplessness and wanting to get better. I am trying to do everything I can to figure out exactly how to help. She has a lot of signs that she believes may be autism. We do have lots of autistic people in our family, so this isn\u2019t a wild idea. She didn\u2019t have any of the typical early childhood symptoms though, but due to her own social media research, she thinks she may be autistic because if her feelings of burnout, need to stim for self soothing, dislike of certain textures and sounds, etc. I am open to this possibility but want to make sure we investigate all possibilities.\r\n\r\nWhat my concern is, is that she may actually be showing signs of early schizophrenia. If this is the case, I would like to get the right interventions in place before a major episode of psychosis potentially causes big problems for her. Here is why I am questioning whether this could be the case: 1) she says she sometimes hallucinates flies, as in she sees flies that she later realizes are not real. 2) Her mental health symptoms get worse at night. 3) She has lots of intrusive thoughts that really upset her, such as thoughts of grisly violent things, harm happening to people she cares about, imagining her beloved cat is dead, etc. I know she must have lots of disturbing intrusive thoughts about herself doing bad things, because she cries a lot that she is a bad person. 4) she admitted she did a very large amount of psilocybin mushrooms at one time (first time user and didn\u2019t know she was using too much) last year and said she had lots of hallucinations when she did it, and that she still gets vivid flashbacks of this. 5) she has paranoid thoughts and fears sometimes about things like there being people in the walls or attic. 6) she gets really upset about things sometimes if she makes a mistake like spilling a bowl of food and then she hits herself and talks about self harm. \r\n\r\nI am not sure if these might be early signs of schizophrenia or not. I have tried to do research and read some people say that hallucinations of insects were their first signs. I don\u2019t know how long it takes to go from that to big breaks in reality though. Can anyone share your experiences with me? I just want to help her but am not sure how. I am NOT expecting or asking for anyone to attempt to offer a diagnosis, obviously. What I am interested in is hearing from people with schizophrenia as to what your first symptoms were and how long did it take from those to first episode of psychosis? Also, if anyone with a diagnosis other than schizophrenia has had these same types of symptoms, what is your diagnosis? I am still working on finding the right professionals to take these things seriously and I would like to do my own research to take to the professionals as well and just to be more enlightened as to what might be going on. Thank you!",

        "question": "How to not become prejudiced after being abused? Hi at first I\u2019ll admit that I\u2019m writing this post after seeing something triggered my trauma very hard. \r\n\r\nSo to begin with a about two years ago I survived a 3 years long cycle of being both mentally and sexually abused by my girlfriend who was supported in the entire thing by her family (entirely female), also a lot of this came to be with them weaponising toxic patriarchal standards and stereotypes. This entire thing really badly skewed my view of women. \r\n\r\nAs someone who was always big on not generalising people and viewing everyone as an individual I somewhat overcame it in day to day basis to the point that I have no problem with the fact that most of my friends are female. \r\n\r\nBut still as a rather progressive left-leaning person I often visit internet spaces which are also frequently feminist spaces. And giving examples from Reddit (I won\u2019t give the exact subs names) I\u2019ve seen a lot of discussions about male abuse, mental health and effects of toxic masculinity on them. And unfortunately I\u2019ve seen a lot of women commenting (and being highly upvoted) things like \u201cthose problems are caused mostly by other men\u201d \u201cwomen are still most affected\u201d \u201cit\u2019s not our job to do anything about it\u201d today I even saw a comment (with 100+ upvotes) about how a man can\u2019t even be raped, and causes of man being SA by a woman are so rare that they aren\u2019t even worth taking care about. \r\n\r\nAnd I\u2019ll admit that seeing things like that triggers something in me and al that calm logical non-generalising thinking about which I talked about and which allows me to normally and friendly interact with women gets thrown out the window, and In filled with I m not sure how to exactly describe it but with some kind of mix of anger and extreme fear and resentment, feeling that that\u2019s how everyone views my experience and that what was done to me is somehow excusable or viewed as unimportant by most women. \r\n\r\nI\u2019m sorry if what I\u2019m writing is a bit of an incoherent rambling but I\u2019m not in a really good place right now\r\n\r\nI wanted to ask if anyone experienced similar feelings/issues with any group of people (not exactly women) caused by their trauma, and if you did, how do you dealt with it?",
        "answer": "Yes I have experienced exactly that and have even been banned from the lgbtq+ community for talking about my rape story publicly and one of the mods found it offensive because \"men can't be raped\". I don't understand the world view of a person like that or what kind of mental gymnastics you must undergo to find yourself in that level of self-brainwashing. I also was banned on the LGBT community for asking a simple question that wasn't offensive but I won't get into any of that because of how unrelated it is. However still I feel the need to mention it because of just how volatile that community can be when it all seems like they just want to stroke their offended ego instead of having actual conversations that are productive.\r\n\r\nHonestly the only way to deal with it is to advocate for yourself even when you experience backlash and to learn how to grow a thicker skin as harsh as that sounds but that is what I have found I must do in order to change anything. I know that sounds harsh to say but it is the lesson I learned because people on the internet are not going to be nice to you and if you want to survive it you must learn how to not let it get so far under your skin. It unfortunately will always affect you or at least it still does for me, maybe one day that will change. I really don't know if it will change but all I know is staying quiet is the worst thing that you can do because it only serves to validate what they say if men like us stay quiet about these things.",

I can check the box with every of the 9 traits of BPD(1 is kinda maybe because i don't remember or notice it but it's more probable that it is true), does that mean i do have it?\r\n\r\nI know there is something wrong with me i just don't know what i haven't visited a professional YET, i plan to go get diagnosed and get therapy for my problems.\r\n\r\nI'm not going to self diagnose i am just wondering if that means that i actually might have BPD?",
        "answer": "The thing with personality disorders is that most people will be able to check the symptoms as they are, usually, things that everyone can experience. It becomes an issue when these things take an impact on your day to day functioning. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, I don't know your age but what I describe above (being able to tick off the symptoms) is particularly prevalent around puberty due to the influence of hormones - for this reason the BPD diagnosis is rarely given to anyone under the age of 18.\r\n\r\nEssentially, just ticking off the symptoms does not mean you have it, and self diagnosing can be difficult when it comes to mental health for a variety of reasons. However, don't let this hold you back from seeing a doctor - if you feel there is something wrong you know you the best, and the earlier you get treatment the better the prognosis. Good luck!",

        "answer": "It depends on where you are. Do you have parents that take your health seriously? Start by going to them. They can and most likely will help you access resources. If it is impossible for you to safely address this with your parents (they\u2019re abusive, etc), then does your school offer counseling services? Ask them about the nature of the services and who provides them. If you feel comfortable with them, do that. You can find another adult you trust as well, like a family member, friends\u2019 parent, or teacher.\r\n\r\nDo you have health insurance? If you do, you can call the customer service number on the back of the card and ask them what providers you can access near you. Please know that they send service summaries every few months by mail, so your parents might find out about it like that.\r\n\r\nIf you dont have health insurance, call places like Planned Parenthood and ask about resources.\r\n\r\nAgain, you absolutely should talk to your parents if the only thing holding you back is  feeling embarrassment or feeling scared of disappointing them. Im only suggesting alternatives in case speaking with them places you in an unsafe situation.\r\n\r\nThis article seems like a great resource and does a much better job of offering advice than I am: https://www.rethink.org/advice-and-information/about-mental-illness/learn-more-about-symptoms/self-harm/\r\n\r\nYou can and should seek help. There is no reason for you to bear the weight of this on your own. Things can and will get better. You are already taking steps in that direction by recognizing you have a situation, and that you need help to address it. Take the next steps. Future you will be very grateful.",

Exercise is not going to summon your hunger, you\u2019re expending even more energy when your body is already trying to tell you it needs food, so you\u2019re only making the issue worse if you\u2019re exercising while starving. Try to graze on small bites throughout the day if a big meal is too much for you, just to get something in ur stomach. Aim for something with decent protein or fiber for energy, don\u2019t snack on just lettuce or something. Nuts, nut spreads and crackers, cheese, boiled eggs, veggies and hummus, all great options. And make sure you\u2019re replenishing electrolytes and drinking lots of water, the nausea could be from dehydration too. Eat dinner closer to bed time or have a little snack before bed if you\u2019re going to bed feeling hungry and waking up sick. You gotta honor your body\u2019s needs in order to start feeling better!

I\u2019m a recovering bulimic, I haven\u2019t purged in over a year but I still struggle with laxative abuse but I\u2019m working on it. \r\n\r\nMy husband has some disordered eating habits of his own but in a different way. He\u2019s very diet focused and will fast if it means hitting a weight goal, things like that. He doesn\u2019t see what he has as an ED, which is fine I\u2019m not a doctor but it\u2019s still harmful behavior sometimes.\r\n\r\nBut he says things that are very triggering for someone who is recovering. For instance like I\u2019ll eat like a candy bar or something and he\u2019ll be like \u201cbad!\u201d But he\u2019ll say it like he\u2019s talking to a dog. It\u2019s very demeaning and very triggering. I know candy bars aren\u2019t good for me but the point is balance. When I was heavy into my ED there was no balance and often times I would eat something like that and purge it. \r\n\r\nI\u2019ve tried talking to him about this by telling him how it makes me feel but he dismisses me and says things like \u2018I just need coffee\u2019 or that I\u2019m \u2018acting like a teenager\u2019 because I \u201crebelled\u201d and didn\u2019t put the candy bar down etc. \r\n\r\nHow do I get him to understand that it\u2019s very hurtful but especially for someone who is recovering from an eating disorder or if that\u2019s not possible how can I block it out so I don\u2019t slip back into my old habits?",
        "answer": "I would tell someone who was dating someone like this **not to settle for men like that**, but since you're already married I recommend marriage counseling, pronto.  You do not need someone in your life who cannot listen to you when you calmly and clearly express your very reasonable needs, and he needs to change.  Asking him to change to eat and feel exactly like you do about food is too much, but that's not what you're doing here.  You're asking him to refrain from making comments about what you eat and to not dismiss you or mock you when you express your needs.  He sounds childish.  I would still think you need to go to couples counseling even if he did take kindly to you asking him to stop making comments about how you eat, because you both need to learn to navigate the fact that he is going to continue to diet and use behaviors that wouldn't be helpful for you as a recovering person.",

Your body is getting used to digesting food again, and I can see that being difficult on your bowels. I would suggest trying bowel rest, which means choosing foods that are easy to digest: oatmeal, bananas, rice, apples/applesauce, toast with peanut butter, etc. This will give your bowels an opportunity to readjust to digestion, which is what you should probably be focused on right now \u2014 rest & digest + recovery.

These are unsubstantial things that probably no one else remembers about me but they absolutely haunt me. Does anyone else experience this? How do you cope with it?",
        "answer": "It's common for people to dwell on embarrassing memories because they can be emotionally charged. I personally have had this happened to me many times, mostly in periods of my life where my anxiety was more heightened.\r  \r\n\r  \r\nOne way to cope with embarrassing memories is to practice self-compassion. This means being kind and understanding towards yourself when you have these thoughts, rather than criticizing or berating yourself. It can also be helpful to remind yourself that everyone makes mistakes and has moments they're not proud of. It is not worth thinking too much about those moments, I promise you everyone has had embarrassing moments.\r  \r\n\r  \r\nAnother strategy is to reframe the memory by focusing on the positives. For example, if the embarrassing memory is from a social situation, you might remind yourself of the friendships or connections you made in that situation, rather than dwelling on the specific mistake or embarrassment.\r  \r\n\r  \r\nYou can also try to distract yourself when you find yourself dwelling on an embarrassing memory. Engaging in activities you enjoy can help you build more confidence, and this confidence will counteract or override the feelings of self consciousness over these memories. Focusing your time in and effort on practicing a hobby or doing a pleasant activity is key,  because you will feel better afterwards with yourself too. Personally this is what helped me the most to stop dwelling in awkward memories. \r\n\r\nI hope this helps!",

I'm pretty sure she Hestitated for some time but still gave me her username.

        "answer": "What comes to mind for me (as an adult) is that you can talk to *your* parents.  Let them know what you saw, why you're concerned, etc.  Getting help for minors is primarily an adult responsibility.  What your parents choose to do with that information is up to them, and I think that your only responsibility in this is to remind your friend that you're here to be supportive of her getting the help she needs, with the understanding that it is likely professional help, and that as minors you guys can't really do that without parental involvement.  If your parents are not friends with each other, your parents can always contact a school guidance counselor who can pass along the concern, or they can reach out to them on facebook, etc.  \r\n\r\nYou can let her know how much the friendship means to you, how sad you would be if the ED took a larger and larger role in her life and got between the two of you, etc. but it's not your responsibility to care for her.  I will say that it's likely that her parents are aware of the ED from what you've shared, but maybe not aware of this tumblr account.  It sounds like something that isn't helpful for her to have, but managing what is or is not allowed on her phone is part of the parents' responsibility.",

He starts crying and freaking out when this happens saying \u201chelp me mom\u201d and \u201cwhy is this happening?!\u201d. His vision is affected afterwards for a short time with everything looking \u201csmaller than usual\u201d to him.  It\u2019s been almost every night for the past week. It started last weekend and he thinks it\u2019s connected to watching the movie Spirited Away. \r\n\r\nThe best nights are when I give him benedryl (did two nights) and I do a meditation with him to get him to sleep. The benedryl seems to keep him from waking at night where it would start again. But tonight, no benedryl and he woke up twice hearing the thing and completely panicked worse than ever before. I was able to help him after a shower to get back to sleep eventually. \r\n\r\nI\u2019m lost and scared for him. I don\u2019t know what kind of doctor to start with for this, but we need someone\u2019s help asap. Do I need a psychiatrist? Neurologist? Therapist? I\u2019m so lost and afraid. I don\u2019t know how serious this is. Our health ins sucks and not a lot of docs take it. Do I talk to his GP? \r\n\r\nOutside of this, he\u2019s a completely happy, smart, strong & independent kid. He has friends and makes friends easily. He is doing well in school and loves soccer and basketball. Nothing traumatic has happened to him and our family is solid and loves him and his older brother with all our hearts. \r\n\r\nVarious people in our family have had issues with anxiety and depression. My son has also panicked before about being afraid of throwing up. \r\n\r\nCan someone give me some direction, insight, a starting point, anything?  Thank you so much.

        "answer": "1. Accept that you're doing this behavior (b/p) to make something about your life right now feel better. \r\n2. Accept that the bulimia is actually making everything worse. \r\n3. Accept that you will need to replace the b/p coping behavior with another, superior coping mechanism (such as medication, therapy, etc.) \r\n4. Accept that weight/fat has an outsized significance to you and that you need another source of self-esteem.\r\n5. Make a meal plan. Stick to it. (A dietician/nutritionist can help you with this.)  \r\n6. The cycle is this: Restriction (I just won't eat much, then I'll stay thin) leads to an intolerable desire for 'forbidden' foods ('trigger' foods, binge foods) which, once eaten, must be purged, leaving your body begging you for nutrition and hydration to heal itself, thus increasing your desire for those calorie-dense foods once more, even as you, now at the beginning again, attempt to return to your regular, restrictive eating.\r\n7. You must interrupt this cycle **at every step.**\r\n8. Do not restrict. No 'banned' foods. It's important to eat a couple of donut holes to show yourself that your weight will not spiral out of control, and that you can enjoy any food in moderation.\r\n9. Do not binge. See above. Buy your food in smaller quantities or divide your meals into perfect portions while you're in early recovery, if this helps.\r\n10. Do not purge. Even if you did binge. Because purging only guarantees you'll purge again.",

Recently I\u2019ve started to feel good again and I did it through setting goals that mean things to me. I started working out and studying loads being more productive and social and it improved my life a lot. It might be basic advice but I suggest to feel again set some goals that mean alot to you and work hard for all of them. When you do that you\u2019ll feel accomplishment and find the truth of your life. The reason you probably feel so empty right now is because you may be just getting through each day living with no meaning once you find purpose and do things that matter to only you everything starts to improve. My apologies for this not being the best response but I read what you said and just wanted to share what helped me. I wish you the very best of luck my friend and I wish for you to feel great :)",

Just keep taking them and if it needs to be increased or another medication needs to be added in combination then cross that bridge with your doctor when you get there.

It's eating whatever I want whenever I want it, but still making sure to eat sufficiently and to eat enough carbs/fat/protein/fruit and veg.

        "answer": "Boundaries are things you impose on yourself. \"I am unwilling to be with someone who smokes cigarettes.\" You are making a decision on how to handle yourself and your relationships by deciding what **you** will and will not do. However, if you say \"You cannot smoke.\" you are trying to control what someone else does, not yourself. You cannot make someone stop smoking, that is not within your power or right. You can however choose to not date people that smoke.\r\n\r\nI have boundaries around my relationship with my mother. I can't change her, but I can choose to stop engaging with her if she crosses a boundary I've set for behavior I'll accept or not. It can feel like imposing a rule or trying to control someone when they hear that you won't do something if they do something, but life is about choices and when you decide you don't do something if they do, they then have the ability to choose to be with you and conform to your boundary, or decide they'd rather do the thing you don't want and not be with you.",

        "answer": "If you\u2019re asking this question, chances are the answer is no. Having a superiority complex is not the same as being a narcissist, actually it\u2019s pretty much the opposite. You\u2019ll find people who share your interests. Maybe not every single one, but at least a few, just try to stay open minded!

Someone I know with an ED gets extremely triggered when I eat food around them, especially with the types/amount of food I eat sometimes. I can solve this by simply just not eating in front of them, right? The problem is that I'm not going to starve myself just for their sake and they don't want me to starve myself either and hate being a burden. When we're out with friends and want to go to a restaurant or order food, they can't simply just leave the hang out session or sit in a separate room by themselves as we eat and watch TV.\r\n\r\nThey get severe panic attacks sometimes from the sight of food.

I definitely have disordered eating...\r\n\r\nI have depression and anxiety among other things, and 10 years ago I began to completely lose my appetite and be unable to eat whenever I was under extra stress or extreme distress. Once the extra stress was gone, my appetite would return. Then, 5 years ago, after a time of extended and prolonged trauma, in which my appetite vanished, it simply never came back.\r\n\r\nMy type of depression is anhedonia, meaning I can't feel pleasure, enjoyment or interest in things. I am always bored and empty. I sleep all day. I haven't eaten in the day for years and if I try, I feel sick and it goes right through me within 30 minutes. I resent people who need to eat lunch. It feels so foreign to me. I feel like a robot who never needs food. My stomach never rumbles, gurgles or feels anything. It's like it is switched off and numb, like my ability to feel interest in anything.\r\n\r\nWhen I used to lose my appetite directly from stress, I'd drop lots of weight very quickly (and I was already slim) as I couldn't eat at all and just survived by sipping juice and iced tea, but nowadays, the only reason I'm not underweight is  because I binge eat chocolate, donuts, cookies, and everything sugary and sweet every night about midnight. It's the time I feel less anxious and can just zone out and watch Netflix or something, and stuff myself with sugar.\r\n\r\nLooking back, I then realised I've never eaten much during the day, and as a kid, I had issues eating breakfast and also lunch at school, due to anxiety. I could never finish my dinner either, though I could eat chocolate and cakes as my snacks after dinner, as again, at night time I was more relaxed.\r\n\r\nIs this an eating disorder? It is affecting my digestion and my life in general.",

An ED is usually characterized by intentional restriction of food due to poor body image, a desire to lose weight, and/or a fear of gaining weight. Having a low appetite due to depression is not considered an eating disorder, it's just considered a symptom of depression.

Or is that simply a result of the mental desire that caused the relapse in the first place? \r\n\r\nI have a history of substance abuse myself, but I've never been physically addicted to anything more than caffeine and nicotine. I've \"relapsed\" on the caffeine many times and not had much of a problem with the \"physical\" addiction (except fatigue from withdrawals). As far as the nicotine, once I finally came clean of that; I never looked back. \r\n\r\nIn short: If you relapse after being clean for a decent length of time (a year, for example), does the physical addiction automatically return? Or does it simply feel that way because the mental desire caused the relapse?",

I was using for a long time though so others miles may vary. If I ever decide to treat myself I never use for any longer than a day and even then I still get a very slight withdrawal. I know others experience the same with alcohol as well, and benzos for that matter! Personally I don't get physical withdrawals from caffeine or nicotine only mental ones which don't last particularly long.

Six months? Nine months? A year? More?\r\n\r\nAnd yes, I know I need to stop worrying about it and work on my body image.\r\n\r\nOn the plus side, around the time that I hit my peak I also started getting regular periods!

But now I\u2019m 17, and I don\u2019t want my parents to have access to this info. I don\u2019t remember signing any releases, but it was a couple years ago. Further, my mom works at the hospital, and she\u2019s been friends with my therapist for several years. My parents pay for my therapy if that matters. \r\n\r\nAnyway, sometimes I share something with my therapist and then it seems to come up in conversations with my parents.

        "answer": "Even as a minor, your therapist should not share details about your sessions with your parents. From a professional standpoint, this violates the therapist/patient relationship. It's also a conflict of interest for your therapist to be friends with your parents. It doesn't matter whether your parents pay for your therapy; you have the right to keep your therapy sessions private.\r\n\r\nYou're not overthinking. Maybe this therapist isn't telling your parents everything. Your parents may be bringing up things from your therapy sessions due to queues you're unconsciously giving or out of coincidence. I would still strongly consider switching therapists. You should have a therapist that isn't a friend of your parents and is outside of the hospital network that your mother works for.\r\n\r\nIf your therapist is a professional, they will keep their emotions out of the equation and encourage you to do what you think is best for your mental health. Even if they're perfectly innocent of what you think might be happening, the fact that you think it is happening is damaging enough to the therapist/patient to warrant finding a new therapist. You need to be able to feel comfortable telling them anything without fearing the judgement of others; you can't do that if you suspect that they're telling your parents everything.",

        "question": "Can you have an ED if your problem is with food itself instead of your appearance? This is most to know if I should get help with it. I have an extremally difficult relationship with food. \r\n\r\nAs a small kid, I was very picky and vomited without inducing various times each month. My teachers and relatives tried to make me eat, but I always refused or they forced me and I vomited. They tried it for YEARS without sucess, so they all just gave up so I could at least eat something.\r\n\r\nIn middle school (keep in mind I'm not from US). I've eat only noodles or bread daily. Yes, I had the condition to eat more than that, don't worry, I just didn't eat because I didn't felt like eating or was not hungry enough. In one part of middle school and high school I was in a school that I was 7 am but got there 6am and got out 5pm, got home almost 6pm. I didn't ate before going and I refused to eat all three meals they offered. In some days, almost never, can count in hands, brought a cookie to eat. Sometimes I gave it away, sometimes I ate only half. I got nausea and gagged when people ate around me, because of the smell of the food, because of the sight of someone eating, because of the vision of the fork moving in the disgusting food. It makes me sick. My mom didn't let me use the stove, so I couldn't make food for myself, either. However, I never wanted to cook, what would I make anyway?\r\n\r\nI'm still very picky. I still gag and want to vomit when people eat or when there's food around me. I ate a bit more and not only noodles and bread, even though bread is still my \"main food\". \r\n\r\nLast year one of my teachers asked me about it, because pretty much all my school staff knows I have problems with food. I told her. She said that she is like that too. That she has an eating disorder. I have anxiety so that is stuck in my mind. \r\n\r\nI don't have problems with my body, weight, face, hair and/or clothes. Yeah, some very small insecurities that go away very fast, but I don't really care about it. I was judged a bit when I was younger, but honestly? I do like how I look. Wish I was taller, but have nothing to do with an ED and I can't change it. \r\n\r\nThat said, it's even possible to have an ED without having appearance problems? I never saw ANYTHING about it and if it's I might go to a doctor to figure it out, not really trying to get medical advice on reddit lol",
        "answer": "Yes you can have an eating disorder without body image problems!\r\n\r\nThough body image issues are a common piece of the puzzle, every ED is unique and comes with its own set of challenges.

You're 17 and severely underweight, that's already a good reason to see a doctor as often as you can. I know you're anxious, but sometimes you just need help and monitoring.

He will sit and listen to you, and the deepest, darkest corners of yourself are safe with him. He exists to be a constant source of solace, and asks for nothing in return. He will be with you for as long as you need, and if a time comes when you no longer need him, everything you put into your hugs, he\u2019ll take with him. \r\n\r\nTry giving yourself permission to have a comfort object, an item representing a safe space, and feel things without consequence or expectation. Your teddy bear is not a child - it does not need to be raised or nurtured, and it does not feel resentment or frustration from fulfilling its function. Its role in your life is to nurture you.

        "answer": "I suggest looking into Internal Family Systems therapy to help with this. Main takeaway is not to demonize any self harm thoughts but to listen to them with curiosity and compassion. You can investigate why you wanna kill yourself and see the good in that intention like maybe you\u2019re trying to save yourself from misery or permanent pain, and then from that same calm space, you can thank yourself for caring to prevent pain but state that the plan is self preservation over self harm. \r\n\r\nThe intrusive thoughts can come from not having dialogue between that calm, most current/ present version of you and those parts of you that are hurting more and carrying pain. Just trust that you can hold space to love yourself and create that internal safety in your dialogue. \r\n\r\nFrom your comments/post: \r\n\r\nPart A: fear of being suicidal; demonizing that like saying you\u2019re scared of going \u201cinsane\u201d \r\n\r\nPart B: suicidal; probably really hurting and trying to show you an escape route you clung to before learning healthier coping skills \r\n\r\nYou can speak to these parts of you and offer compassion and understanding and listen without trying to change them. Understanding the positive intent can make the thoughts less scary while also allowing you to calmly decide not to act on those thoughts- like if you understand the suicidal thought is coming from insecurity and wanting to not feel insecure, you can reason with that part of you that insecurity is not permanent, so you won\u2019t react with a permanent solution. That\u2019s just an example. \r\n\r\nSending love and healing your way. Keep it up on the asking for help part. \ud83d\udc95",

I told my nutritionist to add stuff to the food plan because I wasn't able to. I'm still not gaining weight and am so worried about my babies. I'm so worried and at the same time, I want to be done. I'm sick of having to eat and having to gain 20kl and putting my babies' lives in danger because even for them, I can't eat enough! I'm badly anemic and already at high risk of smaller babies. Today, I didn't even wanted to them be born to meet them but to be able to starve myself again. I feel horrible.

        "question": "Med changes for bulimia? Sorry in advance for the long post...\r\n\r\nI started seeing a new psychiatrist in December and she also specialises in eating disorders. I didn't go to her specifically for my bulimia, but figured it was a nice perk. \r\nIn our first session, I told her all the meds I was on, which included Olanzapine (10mg) and Mirtazapine (45mg), which had been recently increased during my last inpatient admission last year. I also gave a general history of what I have been diagnosed with, which is when I mentioned the bulimia.\r\n\r\nShe asked me if I was a smoker (which I am) and how much do I smoke. When I told her she said that when someone is smoking as much as I do, it basically nullifies any therapeutic benefits of Olanzapine only leaving me with the side effects which include weight gain and increased appetite. So she gave me a plan for the following 3 weeks to come off it.\r\nShe also wanted me to start using Recovery Record again (eating disorder logging app) and link her to my profile so she can see how I am going, since she was concerned about how often I said I was binging and purging. Which was no problem for me since I already am logging everything on Lose It anyway. (I've actually been finding it interesting/helpful being able to log my moods, thoughts, behaviours, and urges as well).\r\n\r\nDuring our second appointment on the 27.01, she said that she knew from what I had explained during the last appointment that the bulimia was a significant issue, but she didn't realise how bad it actually is. That everytime she reviews her patient's on Recovery Record, I am always at the top of her list and always in the red. She asked me again if I would consider another eating disorder admission (first/last time I did an ED admission was in 2016) and I told her no.\r\n\r\nShe then said that she wants to take me off Mirtazapine as soon as possible. That because it significantly increases appetite and weight gain, that it was making everything even worse (apparently vets use Mirtazapine on animals that need to gain weight for various reasons, including due to cancer... which blew my mind!). That even though the CPTSD is the primary issue, that the binging and purging was making my anxiety and depression symptoms worse, which then feeds into the eating disorder, and it's just a vicious cycle. Her hope is that by coming off the Mirtazapine and starting a new medication, it will help with one piece of the puzzel. She explained that it wasn't going to get rid of the eating disorder, but maybe if I am not having as often and stronge urges to binge, that I won't be purging as much as I do.\r\nShe actually seemed a bit frustrated that I was not only put on these medications in the first place, but that they increased my doses during my last admission since I have a history of eating disorders.\r\n\r\nSO (lot of background for this one question, sorry), she instead wants to put me on Vyvanse. She said that it's an ADHD medication (which my psychologist is very interested in me trying because she thinks I have ADD), but it has been used to help manage Binge Eating Disorder. Since I am binging, it should help with these symptoms.\r\n\r\nHas anyone been put on Vyvanse to combat bulimia/BED? Have you found it helpful or not? I did a quick google and it does say it has been used for binge eating disorder but am curious to hear other's anecdotal evidence. \r\n\r\nIf you made it to the end... I am impressed haha thank you",
        "answer": "I have heard that\u2019s a good option to try for BED. Also have you talked with your psychiatrist about Wellbutrin? It helps with smoking cessation and is used off label sometimes for adhd and binge eating. Might be something to look into. Good luck!",

To me, it would definitely be worth bringing them up to your therapist... including your use of alcohol to cope with things lately. Even if you're not drinking \"a lot\" right now, it can easily spiral, especially when we are in mentally vulnerable positions.\r\nAlso, you don't have to be in an immediate life crisis to go inpatient. It is there to give extra supports (medication adjustments, group therapy, etc) to people when they need it. Maybe you do need to take some time out of \"life\" and focus on doing things to help you get better. That is okay.

Her thought process right now is just to eat less/only eat \"healthy\" (i put quotations because her and I have different definitions of eating healthy) because she knows she won't feel bad and feel the need to purge. She believes there's more harm done to her body if she purges compared to if she just ate less... I don't know how to help her so right now I'm just here for her. \r\n\r\nTo sum it up, I'm wondering what is a good way to reply to her when she talks to me about her ed and if any of you guys have more suggestions on how she could meet her goal?",
        "answer": "I don\u2019t know how to put this, so if anyone has better phrasing or clarification please help. You have to be careful with listening to the spiral of ED thoughts. Sometimes having an audience makes the irrational thoughts she\u2019s sharing more real.

I guess what I\u2019m trying to say is if you listen, don\u2019t validate irrational thoughts. But it\u2019s a really tricky line and I\u2019m not saying don\u2019t listen.",

Everyone's journey is unique and what's normal for one person might not be for another. Just because you're finding peace without some of your friends doesn't mean you have to completely cut them out of your life.

This doesn\u2019t mean that you\u2019ve been getting perfect grades and never doing anything wrong recently.

They only happen at night, and while it takes a while, I can usually calm down from them. A few weeks ago, I had a bad one. I had a cold, and tried to take a bunch of cold medicine in the middle of the night to fall asleep. It just made me really high, and afraid i would die. That was the first time i ever woke my mom up when i was having one. 3 days ago, monday, i was in class at 10:15. I had just taken 2 ibuprofen, when suddenly I remembered the cold medicine incident, and started having a panic attack. I had to call my mom to come get me, and she brought me home. Since that, I've been going in and out of panic attacks. Three whole days. It's felt like weeks. Its the worst in the morning, then throughout the day it goes in and out, and then is bad again before bed. In morning and night, I usually get an actual panic attack (dread feelings, shaking, unable to breathe) and i cant eat anything, but after i do i sometimes feel better. And throughout the day when im not having shaking or severe flushes of the dread, panic feeling, I have a lingering feeling of it that never goes away, and i still cant breathe deeply. I havent gone back to school because im always really bad in the morning, and when i try to go back during the day, im just to scared. We went to a doctor yesterday, but they didnt do anything. Im going to my therapist tomorrow. I want to go to school. I dont want my parents to be disappointed. Both tuesday and this morning, I swear i was really trying to go to school, but i was just too afraid. Im constantly on the verge of a panic attack or crying, and it never stops.

I have had panic attacks, generalized anxiety, and mild OCD and social anxiety since I was a teenager (29 now). I was diagnosed by a family doctor and given a daily prescription (which I never took). I was also prescribed Xanax by an urgent care center, which I also never took. I have been able to get a lot of my anxiety under control as compared to how I once was. I am looking into seeing a therapist to further help me learn coping skills and other behavior modification skills. Does anyone have experience with therapy? Had it been effective for you? How often do you normally go?\r\n\r\nAlso, I have an emotional support dog who greatly assists me during periods of high anxiety or panic attacks. He helps whether by laying in my lap for snuggles, a buddy to be with me, or a distraction for playing or going outside, etc. I know the online sites are scams and many people try to scam to get free airline fees for their pets, etc. Does anyone have any legitimate experience with getting a certified letter from your therapist? ",
        "answer": "Hiya. You ask very good questions.\r\n\r\n>Does anyone have experience with therapy? Had it been effective for you? \r\n\r\nSeeking professional help is easily the best decision I've ever made and will ever make. My therapists have provided so much support, refused to give up on me, taught me coping skills to fight depression and anxiety and PTSD (Cognitive Behavioral Therapy and EMDR), given me a private place to express myself, taught me how to express myself, always given me objective feedback and advice on my issues, helped me keep my head above the water, helped me keep moving forward, challenged me, given me hope, inspired me, validated my struggles, shown me so much compassion, helped me think more objectively, helped me become much healthier, helped me with the grieving process, helped me be able to leave my home, and showed me that my life is worth living.\r\n\r\n>How often do you normally go?\r\n\r\nI usually go to therapy once a week, but there have been times when I've gone once every two weeks. \r\n\r\n>Does anyone have any legitimate experience with getting a certified letter from your therapist? \r\n\r\nWhile I do not have any experience with this, I know many others who have emotional support animals and service dogs. They were able to get a letter from their doctors without any issue. I think it's definitely worth asking a therapist or your doctor about getting documentation.\r\n\r\nAlso, if you've never been in therapy before and you have any questions (like what types of questions you would be asked by a professional, how to prepare for a first appointment, how first appointments usually go, or my personal experiences with professional help), then don't hesitate to ask me.

I have GAD and a phobia of vomiting, and we were in a beer tent. I was overwhelmed and asked to leave, so my BF came back to the tent with me and we missed the rest of the night. As soon as we left the field, I started to feel like I was being manipulative and lying about my anxiety. \r\n\r\nAnother example is when I needed to minute a very important meeting at work.

I\u2019ve literally had exes tell me I\u2019m the best girlfriend that they\u2019ve ever had. But there\u2019s times that I truly hate myself. There\u2019s times that I want to punish myself. Every day really. \r\n\r\nWe are the way that we are for a reason. It doesn\u2019t mean that we don\u2019t know what it means to love somebody. It doesn\u2019t mean that we don\u2019t understand fidelity. It doesn\u2019t mean that we aren\u2019t sensitive. It doesn\u2019t mean that we won\u2019t make the best friend someone ever had. None of it.\r\n\r\nFrankly, how we feel about ourselves doesn\u2019t even mean that we\u2019re bad people. Like all the shit that I do, is to myself. I would rather die then hurt someone else. \r\n\r\nFor me, I just feel like I\u2019m too fucked up to ever be with someone. I just don\u2019t think the man for me exists. But in no way should you ever feel like you don\u2019t have really fucking amazing things to offer just because you have personal issues.\r\n\r\nPeople who say that you have to love yourself before you can love anyone else, are really just ableists who lack the ability to empathize. They are also wrong. I was going to post some links but I figured maybe instead I could suggest to you to search online this subject. Psychology Today has a few articles that I found. If I can find this one source that I think is kind of perfect, I will share. I just have to find it. I remember when I read it, It really spoke to me because I used to think that I had to love myself first. But I only thought that because that\u2019s the BS I heard when I was much younger. \r\n\r\nAlso, we should never ever tie our value to what other people think of us.

That sadness that seems to come from within your chest and then wrap itself around you until you become cocooned inside it. You don't want to move, eat, go anywhere, do anything, see anyone. Lay in bed for days. Leave dishes everywhere, stay in the same clothes for days, don't answer your phone. Let your plants die, pile up dirty clothes. It sucks. But it's warm and comforting like a nostalgia from years ago, like a weighted blanket you can't keep off of you.\r\n\r\nI used to have these kinds of episodes. On smaller scales, not super long periods of time, but I was dealing with this. Since then I've spend each and every day just clawing my way out of that blanket; forcing open the cocoon. Fight to keep myself functional, as a productive human being.\r\n\r\nI can't afford to go into a depression like this. I have a job, a life. But damnit if I'm not inclined to take a week or 2 off of work so I can fall into this again.\r\n\r\nDepression sucks. Don't get me wrong. I hate being in the middle of a delicious meal and then getting hit with a pang of deep sadness so strong that I have absolutely zero appetite and have to throw that great food away. At my worst I didn't eat for days. I tried to claw myself from that blanket and I just couldn't. That strength of fight I need to keep myself afloat just wasn't there. I would make myself bowls of top ramen just to take 2 bites of it, almost vomit, and pour it out. These episodes really suck. \r\n\r\nBut they're almost addictive. I have a hard time talking about this in therapy. I say that I almost want to be depressed, and they look at me like I'm crazy. Or worse, they'd gently, almost unintelligibly, raise an eyebrow and give a soft \"huh\" before writing something down on their clipboard. I hate the clipboard. \r\n\r\nBut I can't be the only one.

When I would get joy out of laying in bed at 4 am, watching tim Burton movies and cutting (as edgy as that sounds- i only did it once).

        "question": "Does anyone else get anxious when they hear any type of yelling? Before I start, I want to mention that I have not been diagnosed with anxiety so far, but this is the only community where I feel like I can let this out and ask this question. (Also im new to Reddit and don\u2019t know how exactly this works, so if I do anything wrong please let me know) \r\n\r\nSo I\u2019m currently 18 years old and as for my childhood I\u2019d say it was okay. I was a pretty shy and \u2018good\u2019 kid so never got into trouble much. That\u2019s also why I can\u2019t recall ever being yelled at or hit. Maybe once, but my parent did apologise and state what they did wasn\u2019t okay so I don\u2019t think that would have affected me.\r\n\r\nHowever, I get so anxious when I hear anybody yell. It doesn\u2019t even have to be directed at me. A few examples: one of my teachers has a pretty strong, loud voice. When he suddenly calls out a student\u2019s name while I\u2019m doing my homework, I pretty much flinch even though his tone isn\u2019t even angry. \r\n\r\nOr a few weeks ago when a classmate wasn\u2019t wearing a mask, a teacher followed them into our classroom and basically yelled at them for at least a minute. While this was going on, I forced myself to just look down at my notebook and focus on anything but the yelling. Though I tried to distract myself, my eyes were teary and I felt a lump in my throat and I was really tense for the rest of that class. I think that was the most anxious I had felt in years. \r\n\r\nMy sibling who is 12 can be described as a \u2018troublemaker\u2019 I guess. They\u2019re the opposite of me which can be good at times, but it sometimes gets on my parents\u2019 nerves. They don\u2019t listen, aren\u2019t okay with being told \u201cno\u201d and pretty much do what they want when they feel like it. Because of this I often hear my parents being upset at them and I\u2019ve heard my parent yell at them a lot. Sometimes I\u2019d be in the same room, other times I\u2019d be in my room and they\u2019d be downstairs. During these times I\u2019ll also get very tense and just have a horrible feeling. If I\u2019m in the same room I won\u2019t even say a word and just get up and leave because it\u2019s too much. \r\n\r\nI have no idea what to do with this. I have an intake at a therapist next week for some mental health related issues, should I bring this up too? And does this happen to anyone else? I really don\u2019t understand why this happens to me \r\n\r\nThank you in advance for the help :)",
        "answer": "I absolutely HATE yelling. Like really, really bad. I\u2019m no sigmund freud but for me it\u2019s definitely because I grew up in an incredibly shaky household. My family was always fighting, police coming in and out of my house, just overall not fun stuff. So I\u2019m assuming that has something to do with it for me. Definitely bring this up with your therapist, perhaps they will be able to help that initial trigger, but regardless bringing up any trigger is only going to help you and your therapist work on a treatment plan. If this is your first appointment, try and spend a few minutes and just jot down the things, the moments, and the people that make you anxious. It\u2019s only going to help. Best wishes and good luck!",

        "question": "I feel like I can't journal anymore (digitally or on paper) because I'm too afraid of other people finding it. Does anyone relate? This might be kind of niche. I used to practice journaling when I was younger (usually in a word doc) because I found it to be therapeutic. I also did some creative writing. Now, I struggle to record anything - either digitally or on paper (in something like a journal) - because I feel too anxious about other people finding it. Even if my concerns aren't plausible at all, it's still distressing to me. This has gone on for several years now. I feel like the only place my thoughts and feelings are truly safe is inside my own head. \r\n\r\nI feel like having some sort of outlet would really help me, but how can I find an outlet when nothing feels safe? A few years ago I started to really struggle with anxiety surrounding all things cyber-security related. Nowadays I only use open source software, encrypt all of my files, avoid all forms of social media, don't use google or google products, use a stripped down version of windows with telemetry blocked through my firewall, etc. - and it still doesn't feel like enough. I still feel very exposed. \r\n\r\nI used to struggle with feeling like I was somehow being watched/observed (even though I always knew that was ridiculous) and still do to some extent. Even the front facing camera on my phone is covered up. I feel like I can't achieve real privacy no matter how hard I try. I don't even like to think about things like my smartphone (where I have less granular control over settings) or the 'anonymous' accounts I use on reddit because the realization that those things probably aren't anonymous at all makes me feel sick. \r\n\r\nDoes anyone else relate? I feel completely stuck. I need some sort of outlet but can't express myself properly when I constantly feel paranoid about being monitored or having my data snooped on somehow. It's exhausting.",
        "answer": "Omg yes all the time. That\u2019s the reason I haven\u2019t started a journal yet. I always think people are going to find things out in the most unrealistic ways.

I had been addicted to World of Warcraft in 2008/2009 so as you can imagine I was quite good at the game. I went cold turkey when I started going to college in the fall of 2009 and I recovered. But I always thought of myself as good at that game. I took pride in it. \r\n\r\nA few years later (2018 or so) I went to an Internet cafe, downloaded the game and fired it up. I quickly realized though that I was not only no longer good at the game but I simply had no idea how to move my character; one of the most basic parts of the game. It shattered my word view and caused some kind of existential dread. I sat there in disbelief soaking it up but left without doing anything more. \r\n\r\nSimilarly, I grew up bipolar and my psyche was scarred with the knowledge that I was a danger to myself and to others with my emotional issues and mania. It wasn\u2019t until I met my now ex in 2018 that she helped me repair my self image of myself by loving me unconditionally and helping me unravel that negative self image. But I never had that \u201cmoment\u201d where it all clicked. \r\n\r\nBut, what is it like to realize.... \u201cpeople view me as X and I had no idea\u201d? Was it an incident? A destiny with drugs?

        "question": "I am a mindless internet zombie I'm 26. I discovered the internet when I was about 11 years old or something. And it was so fucking awesome! I was doing so much creative shit. I built actual friendships! I was authentic and honest. I was free on the internet. Free to fuck up and restart. Free to explore. Free to express myself. Free to try stuff out. In my case it was better than real life\r\n\r\nThese days I'm starting to feel actual hate towards the internet. What is this shit? I'm just mindlessly scrolling through reddit, Facebook, Instagram and Youtube. I'm lucky if I can get myself to mindlessly play some boring game. There are still moments where I have fun, but they are rare. Maybe an hour from 11 hours doing mindless shit was actually enjoyable.\r\n\r\nEverything seems fake. Polished. Copied. Everyone wants clicks. Everyone wants to get famous for the most basic crap. Everyone wants to be positive. Anonymity? Oh please. Instagram pretty much automatically connects you with all your \"friends\". How? No idea! Clickbait everywhere. The same memes Everywhere. Everything is predictable. It's like some shallow simulation. At least there are some trainwreck influencers!\r\n\r\nI'm so sick and tired of it. I wish I could say that I'm the exception, but I'm just the same. I'm part of the system. I'm a mindless scroll & click & copy zombie. When I put my phone away I literally stare into space. Nothing comes up. Nothing is left. Not anymore.\r\n\r\nThey got us addicted and it works so well. My thumb constantly hurts these days? Does it make me stop? No.\r\n\r\nBefore Christmas I thought \"After New Years I need a break from people and media.\". I dropped that idea. But maybe I should just do it. I'm so bored and depressed. I once was so creative.\r\n\r\nThe people topic would be a completely different one, but it's also just the same. Just mindless, boring conversations in my life. Nothing authentic. Nothing genuine. Am I stuck in the Sims?",
        "answer": "Do it. Take a break from the digital world and people. Trying something radically different like that can be very refreshing for this kind of trudging through a rut mindset. \r\n\r\nThe important part is to have a goal or a few going into it. What are you going to do instead? Pick up a book instead of your phone? What if you limit digital things instead of cold turkey go without? That way you can devote time to trying new games or something. Take an online class that allows you to go at your own pace w/ limited interaction. Start a blog or journal about your experience on this journey. Tell your friends you'll be unavailable for x amount of time and you look forward to returning refreshed. Start handwritten pen pal letters with some friends and express that you want to feel more connected in the real world.\r\n\r\nIt's not hopeless, it's not the sims, it's just how the internet unfortunately developed. It was once more open and free and expressive, and now it's about mass media manipulation and installing maladaptive behavioral changes. If you haven't seen 'The Social Dilemma' on Netflix, make sure you check that out.\r\n\r\nIt's hard to unlearn and undo maladaptive behaviors and coping skills but definitely possible! Looking into behavioral therapy models like CBT, DBT, REBT might give you specific tools to unlearn some of these behaviors and automatic thoughts.\r\n\r\nI totally understand where you're coming from and recently disconnected from all social media besides Reddit myself. It's hard and I find myself staring at nothing and just zoned out a lot. As soon as I become aware that's happening, I remind myself it takes work and effort to replace the emptiness and it's okay if it takes time to build up other habits and hobbies. Just do the next right thing. And I usually get distracted again and repeat. It's getting better. I feel better even though I'm struggling cause I know I'm building better habits. Baby steps!",

Thank you for helping me feel like I\u2019m not alone in this!",
        "answer": "Definitely! I find a lot of really small things incredibly daunting - humans have a way of wanting to remain idle and fight against change. Even if that change is a new book or tv show. \r\n\r\nIt often happens because it almost feels like work. You might feel guilty for going on Reddit, or watching the same old TV. So you project this new experience as something you *should* do and your usual habits as something you *shouldn\u2019t*. \r\n\r\nTry and reframe your thinking and tell yourself that it\u2019s OK to go on Reddit - but it\u2019s also OK if you don\u2019t want to. And it\u2019s OK to not want to read a new book, but it also could be really fulfilling (as it often is). Once you train this muscle by actually following through with new activities, it\u2019ll become like second nature. Sometimes you might \u201cfall off the wagon\u201d and return to routine, but that\u2019s perfectly ok! It\u2019s only natural. What\u2019s important is understanding that once you want to leave that routine, you\u2019re fully capable at any time. \r\n\r\nCheers :)",

I'm not a medical professional, but several things you mentioned are classic symptoms - rocky interpersonal relationships, intense love/hate dynamics with people you care about that are not proportionate to the situation, impulsively spending large amounts of money, extreme fear of abandonment/seeking validation that people care about you.",

I've been to both but even the bad help cause I am still alive. But imo in every ward there is a nurse that is incredible nice even if everything else sucks. also it's hard to say a psych ward is nice, cause it's a lot of work and at the end of the day you're a patient aka you're sick and in a hospital and that's something noone wishes for. \r\n\r\nGood luck!",

        "question": "Does anyone else feel guilty for receiving treatment? (slight vent) (TW: discussion of suicide)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI'm 17. A couple years ago, I tried killing myself (twice). I was rushed to the nearby emergency hospital both times and placed on IV, heart monitor, etcetera. We had financial issues in the past and my mom was always talking about how expensive medication was, how we couldn't afford it, you get it. In my situation, medication was necessary as well as therapy. I was also institutionalized three times. And ever since then i've been going to therapy and taking meds which really helped! But i feel like I don't deserve it. \r\n\r\nMaybe not \"deserve\", but I feel like I'm not worthy of getting better. \r\n\r\nI'm currently doing a project for my health class. One of the things I have to do is analyze the cost of health services - ambulance rides, emergency room costs, other things along those lines. The more I research and discover how expensive these things actually /are/, the more guilt I feel.\r\n\r\nI feel terrible. \r\n\r\nNot only did I traumatize my family, but I also costed them a LOT of money. I'm a fucking shitty person and I wish there was a way to stop existing without causing my family any pain. I'm a huge burden, both financially and emotionally. My mom is always saying she's happy I'm getting better, but I know from the hushed whispers from her conversations with her husband that I'm actually just draining their pocket. She doesn't deserve the amount of stress I'm putting her through. \r\n\r\nI'm the one that tried to kill themselves. It was my fault. Their money should be going to something better. But instead they're stuck with me, stuck paying my psychiatrist and therapy bills, stuck paying for my insurance and medication. \r\n\r\nI can't forgive myself.\r\n\r\nDoes anyone else feel the same way?\r\n\r\nedit: forgot to mention, I'm in the US if it wasn't obvious",
        "answer": "Medical care costs in the US are ridiculous. No, you should not feel guilty for getting sick and needing help. Our brains are sick, it\u2019s a disorder just like diabetes or epilepsy. You didn\u2019t choose to be sick anymore than a diabetic chooses to have an insulin crisis or an epileptic chooses to have a seizure. See how ridiculous it sounds talking about those things? Yet, we blame ourselves for mental health issues. It\u2019s good you are getting help. I\u2019ve been in and out of the hospital and treatment programs a lot in the last 5 years due to my bipolar. It\u2019s been easily over $20k out of pocket for my bills and treatments. My husband points out that he would rather I get better than lose me and to not feel bad about the medical bills. Try to focus on getting better, beating yourself up about things you can\u2019t control won\u2019t help you feel better. Be kind to yourself, you had a crisis and you got the help you needed. I\u2019ve survived several suicide attempts and I\u2019ve always felt so badly after for putting my family through that but I wasn\u2019t in my right mind. Now I know when I need more help. Make a crisis plan and ask for help before you get to the stage of suicide. Don\u2019t hold off because you\u2019re afraid of bills. Your parents would take bills any day over losing you.

But I\u2019ve had heightened anxiety at bedtime for the past few weeks and I don\u2019t really understand why.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s never even about stuff actually happening in my life. Sometimes my chest just feels tight and I feel anxious but I can\u2019t pinpoint what I\u2019m so anxious about. Other times I\u2019m convinced an ax murderer coming to murder me. I don\u2019t live in the safest neighborhood, and I always try to calm down but it *could* happen. \r\n\r\nOr my healthy pet rabbit could die. Or *something bad* could happen.

We\u2019ve been together for over 2 years and not once have I ever questioned his loyalty\u2026 but it\u2019s something about closing my eyes at night that brings out anxiety that isn\u2019t based in reality. \r\n\r\nSleep used to be such a relief from my anxious brain, but I feel like it\u2019s being stolen from me. The worst part is I have actual things I could worry about (bills, politics, school) but when nighttime hits the only thing my brain wants to do is get incredibly anxious over non-existent theft, an imaginary ax murderer, and a relationship problem that purely exists in my stupid mean anxious brain. \r\n\r\nSigh.",

        "question": "Does anyone else suffer from constant chest pain? I need help! I (28F) have pretty severe anxiety and have for years. I went through a really stressful event a few months ago which made my anxiety skyrocket. I have been suffering from chest pains that come and go but sometimes can last all day. It feels like a deep pain or intense burning on the left side of my chest. I\u2019ve been to numerous doctors appointments and have had ECGs, a heart echo, CBC blood test, and comprehensive metabolic panel. The doctor told me there was nothing wrong with my heart and that she would be shocked if a healthy 28 year old was having a heart attack. I am still convinced that somehow the doctor missed something. When I\u2019m in the midst of intense chest pain, it\u2019s hard to not want to go to the ER, but I can\u2019t afford to go to the ER every time the chest pain happens since it\u2019s so frequent. I would probably be there once a week.\r\n\r\nI\u2019m at a point where I\u2019m constantly anxious due to the chest pain which then is probably making the chest pain worse. And sometimes the pain comes up even when I\u2019m not feeling particularly anxious, which then makes me anxious. It\u2019s a never ending cycle.\r\n\r\nHow can I convince myself that I\u2019m not having a heart attack? Is it dangerous to just ignore chest pain and assume it\u2019s anxiety? Now that I\u2019ve had all the tests I question whether my health has changed since having them, even though they were all last month. Are there any other tests I should request to rule out a health problem? \r\n\r\nHelp!",

Sometimes my face gets numb and i get brain fog and it gets me so worried. \r\n\r\nAnxiety is like a bully the more attention you give it the more it torments you. Try breathing techniques and meditation. Breathing has really helped me get some form of control over my body. What helped me the most is exercise. Running or just walking around your neighborhood is a great form to relieve stress and anxiety. Distractions and hobbies will be your best friend. Its okay!

Or you could also eat one as part of a meal. \r\n\r\nAnother thing you can do is to take one bar and put the rest back and leave the kitchen or room. Then have a distraction planned after eating like playing a game, doing a puzzle, talking to a friend, reading, going for a walk, listen to music etc. Distraction can be really helpful when we are dealing with heightened anxiety after eating.\r\n\r\nFinally, set an intention around this food. You can say something to yourself like, \"My intention is to eat this bar and not purge.\" or \"I can trust myself around this food.\" Imagine exactly how you want your interaction with this food to play out. Imagine yourself eating the amount that you want and not engaging in eating disorder behaviors afterwards. Sometimes it helps to rehearse what we want to happen and how we want to feel.\r\n\r\nBest of luck to you! \ud83d\udc95",

        "answer": "Oh I'm so sorry you had this experience it sounds like it was dreadful. \r\n\r\nIf you can find a dietitian who specialises in eating disorders they can be absolute gold. I have an AMAZING dietitian who I really trust and who keeps me wanting to pursue recovery even though I'm struggling. What makes this dietitian so great is that she explains the science behind why we need to eat and what our bodies do with the nutrients and how bulimia affects our bodies. She also counsels me around my behaviours and we look at strategies for managing them. Lastly, she prescribes me a meal plan but we work together to make it with foods I like eating so that it works for me and my lifestyle. \r\n\r\nI think getting a good psychologist as well can be really helpful too. The dietitian will counsel you but they can't do what a therapist can in terms of looking at deep seated emotional issues and ways of thinking, doing and being. \r\n\r\nI'd also recommend finding a good GP who can look after the medical side of things and co-ordinate your care between providers.\r\n\r\nGood luck with your journey, I hope you can build a great team around you to support your recovery.",

It sounds like you are weakening the \"valve\" that keeps stuff in your stomach, which happens when the gag reflex is over-used (ie very common for people with bulimia). That allows acid to come back up, and can lead to \"involuntary regurgitation\" (throwing up \"in your mouth all day\").

        "question": "Obese after Anorexia Hello! \r\n\r\nTldr; Can anyone relate to being obese before/after Anorexia? I feel so alone in this and need help with getting out of it. \r\n\r\nMy ED story:  \r\n\r\nI (F23) developed disordered eating styles due to growing up with CPTSD. For most of my life I have been obese. I've lost all the (over)weight three times. It was at its worst in 2018 right before I finished highschool. I developed heart palpitations and had to see doctors because of severe hip pain; they thought I had osteoporosis, luckily I didn't, but that was a wake up call for me. I made myself go inpatient in 2019, miraculously got pregnant after getting out and gained more than double my weight after that. I ate because I was so scared my body couldn't keep up with being pregnant. Then I ate and ate because I was emotionally overwhelmed and had a  baby. Now I'm at my highest weight ever, active, but I keep overeating and I feel stuck in this loop. Whenever I try to lose weight i swing into anorexic habits. I've tried just focusing on being healthy and active which helps with depression but I can not stop emotional eating when I'm anxious. And i am anxious 90% of the time. \r\n\r\nI hate my body so much and am having a hard time existing. I'm seeing 3 therapists, but I am scared of talking about food issues as it holds a lot of shame. We have scratched the surface and I hope to find the courage to talk about it. For now I hope I can maybe catch some words on here from people who might get it. \r\nOften I feel too gross to even leave the house, which used to be my downfall. Now, having a kid, that is not a thought I am allowing myself to indulge in. As soon as she sleeps it bursts out though. My relationship is definitely taking a physical blow because of it and I'm scared of what will happen when my child picks up on it. I just don't know how to stop this disorder.",
        "answer": "Yes each time I relapsed, I gained a significant amount of weight because I couldn\u2019t stop bingeing - more weight than the time before. I\u2019ve learned that anorexia and restricting are not sustainable as your body will crave food and nutrients. It\u2019s definitely a difficult and shitty cycle to be stuck in so please don\u2019t be afraid about reaching out for help; especially since you have 3 therapists. If it helps, try to find one that specializes in eating disorders and they can help you work through the emotional side of your food issues. My inbox is open if you need to talk \u2764\ufe0f",

What you're going through is normal for the condition you've got and your therapist will likely have the tools to help you manage it.   \r\n\r\n\r\nJust remember, yes its scary coming back to this place, but you're not the same person you were years ago. You're so much better equipped to deal with what's going on, and I can say that definitively without even knowing you because you've already recovered once.   \r\n\r\n\r\nIf you've already recovered once, you can do it again.

When I lapsed years ago (it was a bad lapse though, I was on the verge of recovery) I didn't want to return to therapy or my protective strategies because they represented a time for me that I wanted to leave in the past. But I'm glad I did, because it was a stepping stone to me being recovered as I write this.   \r\n\r\n\r\nOne day, I know I will probably relapse too.

        "answer": "If you want to stop, you\u2019ve come to the right place. This is a pro-recovery r/ after all. These are tips for reassessing your relationship with food, and putting some things into context. \r\n\r\nThat said, let\u2019s put the behaviors into perspective: your body is starving. Starving is not just physical, it\u2019s mental and psychological. When people restrict, the body goes into survival mode, it conserves resources, it clings to any and all nutrition it gets because it believes that it will never see food again. \r\nOnto the mental side, your brain is also an organ that is starving. The \u201cdesperation\u201d and lack of control come from intense hunger. The body knows what it needs. I\u2019m not going to comment on the numbers revolving around your weight, but ~6 months of starvation would inevitably lead to the brain psychologically changing and altering in order to try and save itself. \r\n\r\nI used to restrict all day and end up \u201cbinging\u201d at night. That was my body screaming for help. That was my brain begging me for nourishment. For fuel.\r\n\r\nThe most difficult step towards recovery I took was realizing I couldn\u2019t trust myself to do it alone. I couldn\u2019t trust my altered brain chemistry, my eating disorder, to allow me to recovery. I sought professional help, but I know how difficult it is to actually\u2026 do that. Let\u2019s talk small steps. No particular order, just general tips to harm reduce and start the path to recovery. These are not \u201ctips to lose weight.\u201d This is about restoring a healthy relationship with food.\r\n\r\n- Eat something consistently. Utter restriction leads to compensation, start just eating *something* every couple of hours. Not just one big meal, not just nothing. Something consistently. You can worry about full nutrition later. Just eat something. \r\n\r\n- Meals with friends. Company I find makes mealtime easier. I\u2019m more inclined to enjoy the food- to make a positive experience and connection with food- if I\u2019m eating with people. You deserve positivity. Eating somewhere with a friend or a loved one makes a world of a difference. \r\n\r\n- Separate your thinking as your Eating Disorder. This is a simple way of thinking that can help shift perspective. Look, you\u2019ve got this ED on your back running the show. Separating the you from the behaviors and relationship with food, even the negative comments on your body as your Eating Disorder trying to take you over\u2026 I dunno. It helped me a lot.\r\n\r\n- Write down things you want to do- you need a body to get you there. You need to nourish that body to do it. Sometimes deep in my ED its hard for me to know what I want to do, but if I want to walk around, write my novel, dive into my hobbies- I can\u2019t do that starved and weak, clinging to my ED. I find it a helpful reframe in my priorities.\r\n\r\n- Stop counting calories. Is it easy to? No. I don\u2019t live in the US currently so the nutrition labels are a lot more discrete. Back home I\u2019d slap a post it over them.  This takes time, I still try to roughly estimate in my head- but it\u2019s better than full on counting. \r\n\r\n- Throw out your scale. This is big- but man. I have no idea what I weigh. It\u2019s awesome. I don\u2019t have tips for this, I simply moved somewhere without a scale, but it made a world of a difference. \r\n\r\n- Reach out to others, which you\u2019ve done! I think that\u2019s pretty damn cool, it shows that a part of you separate from your ED wants out. Life doesn\u2019t have to be like this, friend. \r\n\r\n- Think about seeking professional help (if you are able to.) Any support is better than none. There are free support groups online available, you don\u2019t even have to participate, you just have to show up. It makes a difference hearing other people\u2019s stories.\r\n\r\nThis isn\u2019t a comprehensive list, but it\u2019s a start. I\u2019m so glad you reached out. I\u2019m glad you\u2019re here. I can\u2019t take private messages for my own health and safety, but know I\u2019m cheering you on and I\u2019m so proud of you for being here today.",

        "question": "did i have a panic attack? hey all!\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\ni am a very anxious person, and thought i was well versed in what panic attacks felt like for me, however, after today, i feel like i might be wrong. i had an episode today wherein i was being gently reprimanded by a teacher of mine, and while he was talking to me about how i wasn't putting in the work i needed to be putting in, i felt all the blood rush out of my head. as this happened, i got incredibly lightheaded, my vision started to go black, i lost my balance, and eventually all i could hear was blood rushing in my ears. he was able to sit me down and give me water, after which i regained my vision and hearing and was fine. i thought i was going to pass out (the lightheadedness felt very close to how i feel before i pass out due to heat or needles, which is common for me). however, this has never happened. every other time i've *thought* i've had a panic attack, they were far less severe - i get body shakes, sweating, and difficulty breathing, but never have i had my vision/hearing affected to this extreme, nor have i ever felt like i was going to pass out due to anxiety.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nwas just wondering if this was simply a more severe panic attack, or something else entirely? thanks!\r\n\r\n(side note: i dont actually know what \"dae questions\" means as a flair, if i put the wrong thing i'll fix it!!)",
        "answer": "Absolutely, this is not any uncommon symptoms for a panic attack but I would say it's a severe  level compared to the ones you've previously experienced.\r\nIf you also have eaten and drunken badly it makes it extra dizzy and close to fainting because you're hyperventilating, and your body has no energy to deal with the panic attack.",

        "answer": "Hi,\r\n\r\nI've struggled with restrictive eating for a long time and can relate to your problem. Here are a few things I've learned:\r\n\r\nIf I've been undereating, my stomach looses \"stretchiness\". I don't know exactly what's going on, but there's definitely a vicious cycle involved.\r\n\r\nWhen recovering from a relapse, it's not unusual for me to need to start with smaller more frequent meals, and work my way up to larger less frequent meals.\r\n\r\nI've also found it helpful to make sure I'm eating plenty of natural flavorful fats - not so much bland fats like canola oil.\r\n\r\nNo restrictions on saturated fat or cholesterol, I feel worse if I rely too heavy on \"healthy\" unsaturated fats like olive oil, even though I think olive oil is great and use it occasionally.\r\n\r\nWhen I eat plenty of natural flavorful fats like fatty meats and fish, butter, coconut milk, avocado, etc, it literally lubricates the food and makes it go down easier, it makes the food more satiating in a way the motivates me to eat more - but never motivates me to eat beyond what's physically comfortable.\r\n\r\nThe food tastes better, it sits better in my stomach, I'm satiated longer, and fat is calorically dense.\r\n\r\nA lot of people with EDs are scared of fats, especially saturated fats, and animal fats. If that's you, I'd encourage you to challenge your fears and see if eating more fat makes you feel better.",

Then I found out that she also was doing exercises to lose weight.\r\nThen she stopped doing that and even started eating as usual. \r\nBut this last months she every time eats less than before.\r\nSome days ago, she spent the whole day without eating, and she told me that it was just one day. But now, she did not ate for two days, and she told that she inuced herself to throw up today's dinner.\r\n\r\nI recently told her that I think she has en ED and she should visit a doctor, but she totally refuses both of them. I don't know what to do, I'm still trying to tell her that she is not ok. I'm scared that she won't seek for help, I don't want her to get even worse than before. I'm really really scared and worried but I have no idea about what should I do.\r\n\r\nIf someone can just tell me their experiences, or just what can I do\r\n\r\nOr if I can talk with someone who knows about this stuff",
        "answer": "I think an important thing to note here is that OP can\u2019t fix this for her. EDs are nefarious and cruel, they warp people into resentful, paranoid versions of themselves. Your partner is going to have to choose to get help on her own. You can be there, and tell her your concern (I wholly agree with the comments above) but ultimately she has to decide not just to seek help, but to accept it. (In my experience those are two different things, and equally hard to do.)\r\n\r\nBe there, be present, remind her you care about her and want her to experience live with you in the moment. If she doesn\u2019t open up or she refuses to realize her condition- that\u2019s all you can do besides raising concern with others to intervene if she doesn\u2019t herself. EDs come with serious health risks. The fact she\u2019s telling you these issues with food are in itself a cry for help, so I don\u2019t doubt that she\u2019s noticing these changes, but it is scary to be seen as needing help. \r\nYou\u2019re doing the right thing, but you can\u2019t make her choose recovery or treatment (though you can lead her there with family and her support system if necessary) she has to make that call on her own. \r\n\r\nIt\u2019s hard, I know. You\u2019re taking note and I\u2019d definitely suggest asking around to get a support system of friends and family in place. But take care of yourself too.

However, I have some stomach conditions (chronic gastritis, peptic ulcer disease) that make me sensitive to food. I get extremely hungry sometimes and I eat to the point where I feel sick. The intense urge for me to eat like this is fairly common. I believe I am guilty of \u2018binge eating\u2019. I don\u2019t vomit, but I experience serious nausea. I almost feel like I can\u2019t help it because the desire to eat for me feels like a primal urge yet my conditions and possibly binge eating make me feel sick.\r\n\r\nMy current plan is as follows:\r\n- Portion control. Have the portion of food I\u2019m going to eat prepared.\r\n- High fiber, high protein diet, low carbs, low sugar to encourage longer satiation.\r\n- Time the distance between meals.\r\n\r\nAny other ideas?",
        "answer": "Being very strict about macros, rules, etc can actually trigger more binging, so I would be careful with anything like that. \r\n\r\nIt sounds like the high hunger level is a trigger for you. It might be helpful to keep lots of snacks around that are easy on your stomach to avoid getting extremely hungry. Try tuning in to your hunger signals as much as you can (timed meals as mentioned in another comment can help with noticing earlier hunger signals). Even thinking about food is an early sign of hunger. \r\n\r\nBinging is typically a response to restricting. So the extreme hunger triggering a binge makes sense. Something else that doesn\u2019t get talked about too often is that mentally restricting (thoughts like \u201cI can\u2019t eat this\u201d or \u201cI shouldn\u2019t be eating this\u201d) can actually trigger binge behaviors as well. This can be difficult if you have stomach conditions! (I have IBS and no longer have my gallbladder so I can relate!)\r\nSometimes shifting my mindset toward trigger foods can make a difference for binge behaviors. Choosing between \u201cam I prepared for the discomfort of eating this right now?\u201d can help instead of outright telling myself something is totally off limits. \r\n\r\nHope some of this helps!",

        "question": "I just recently started purging\u2026. Idk what to do The purging started because of a near death experience I had involving a food allergy I didn\u2019t know I had, and I ended up having to be hospitalized for two days because of a reaction that I had to this food. An allergic reaction to be very specific, I went into severe anaphylaxis and quite literally could not breathe nor form words whilst in the hospital for the first 5-8 hours I was there. I had to get over three rounds of epinephrine, (basically adrenaline) used for anaphylactic shock, which is an abnormal amount for an allergic reaction. Since then (happened about 2 months ago) I have had intense panic attacks anytime I eat anything other than mac and cheese. And I\u2019ve never had panic attacks before, it\u2019s been such a new experience and an extremely frightening one at that. I was prescribed a benzodiazepine to assist with the physical effects of the panic attacks, but the mental panic is unwavered by these drugs and the physical symptoms have not reduced noticeably. I have yet to been prescribed something else in order to combat these mental issues relating to the panic. I\u2019m 23 y/o and have never dealt with something so incredibly intense, at least that I remember. The purging started shortly after this event, within the first two weeks. Anytime I ate anything (even mac and cheese) I felt the need to get it out of my system. Even though I knew from an allergist perspective that it would not assist in preventing an allergic reaction from whatever food I had eaten, and yet I find it hard to stop. I\u2019ve begun drinking alcohol on a regular basis which assists in my purging. I buy food and basically binge eat until I have a panic attack which causes me to then purge whatever I have eaten. I really don\u2019t know where to go from here and have not had the chance to speak about this to the therapist I have been seeing since the event since the focus of our sessions is the panic relating to food. Idk what to do at this point, I feel so lost. I\u2019ve never felt the need to purge before but now it seems as if it\u2019s the only option.",

Your metabolism can temporarily be raised to deal with the higher input of food. Your body could also be screaming for more after having been restricted so long.\r\nI heard a great analogy for binging:\r\nIt\u2019s like holding your breath. Breathing is so natural, so necessary. Holding your breath (restricting) can only go on for so long before you NEED to breathe. And you don\u2019t just breathe, you gasp for breath after holding it for so long (the binge). You might still be gasping. Still needing to take in more.\r\n\r\nBottom line: your body is trying to get what it needs right now.

I am a depress!on , eating disorder and su!c!de survivor for about a year I never felt this happy and free my entire life tho I am still struggling with anxiety and overthinking.\r\n  On to the story , I am a freshman in highschool and meet M on the hallways , he is 1 grade older than me , BC we are having our classes next to eachother we started talking , for the first or second mouth we just had lil conversation now and then BC I don't usually stay in my classroom cause' my classmates are being to laud , our intercalation were pleasant and just right, he didn't care about my \" style\" and I kinda started to have a hallway crush on him . 2 months ago we started talking more and we exchanged Instagram accounts and started talking some more , we had 2 dates and then he asked me to be his gf over the text ( I never had the hearth to tell him about my gender BC I was scared of what he would say ) I was taken by surprise and didn't know what to do so I just said yes and went on with it . He is a very sweet and caring man and I am Shure that any girl that he would meet he would make her happy like he does it to me , he give me flowers and takes me on dates but for a while I don't feel that happiness anymore. Yes I love him and when he is with me I am happy but when I'm not around him I get extremely anxious and overthink everything, I don't know what to do and it started about 1 week after we started dating . I started to have nightmares , siting in the shower and overthink ( habit that I got rid of with my depression) , barely eat and constantly anxiously checking my phone to see if he texted and to know that I didn't do something wrong or just didn't reply at a text from him . \r\n  I thought of braking up with him but I know that everyone will say that I lead him on and will lose a lot of friends if I do so plus I don't wanna hurt him , he is a great , romantic, sweet and well mannered man that knows how to treat a woman but in the same time I didn't felt so miserable sience 1 year ago .\r\n  Idk what to do , I am the bad person and should suck it up and be happy with this man ?

        "answer": "It seems you have an anxious attachment style. Attachment types are formed in childhood and directly impact how you interact in relationships. Without going into it too much right now, I can assure you are definitely not a bad person. I also used to be an anxious attachment type and felt all the things you listed \u2026. Feeling anxious when my partner wasn\u2019t around, checking my phone if he texted. The root of it is usually subconscious fear of loss. I felt like I wanted to break up with my partner too because it was so overwhelming. I started therapy and this is where I learnt about my anxious attachment style. If you have the resources available, I would definitely recommend therapy. It really helped my process my relationship anxiety and separation anxiety. If you don\u2019t have the resources available, simply google it and learn some tips on steps you can take to slowly become more secure. \r\n\r\nYou are worthy of the love you are receiving from him!!! You say he is great, sweet, romantic and well mannered. That is amazing!!! I know it feels scary when he leaves but remember he is totally into you! I learnt about things I can ask from my partner that helped ease the separation anxiety. Such as checking in, or simple reassurance went a long way. \r\n\r\nAgain, there is nothing wrong with you and you are not a bad person. Your attachment is simply activated. Once you have awareness, it helps because you can understand what is happening and why. \r\n\r\nWishing you lots of luck!! You got this!",

        "answer": "I won't say it's *normal,* but I went through a period of time during my worst purging phases where my body just kind of rejected food as soon as I ate it. No medical background here, but I feel like we maybe just kinda condition our bodies to believe Something Must Be Wrong with food when we force it back up like that all the time (since throwing up is meant to be the body getting rid of something you ate or drank that's harming you).",

        "question": "Will being in a psychiatric hospital ruin my life? If I was put in a mental hospital, would I be able to go to school, college, get a job, and live a normal life? Also would I have access to my phone?\r\n\r\nI\u2019m 14 and maybe a mental health issue. I don\u2019t have a therapist because my problem is kind of directed towards my parents and I don\u2019t want them to know. So I\u2019ve talked to people online but I feel like a burden and I think I probably scare them or something so I don\u2019t really want to say the specific issue but it has something to do with violent thoughts and just overall hatred and anger.\r\n\r\nIf I talked to a therapist, I also feared that they might put me in a mental hospital. But I just want to live a good like so I\u2019ve been trying my best to do good in school and trying to get a job. My issue still persists but I am able to just ignore it and so far it hasn\u2019t harmed me or anyone else. \r\n\r\nSo should I just risk it and try to wait 4 years until I move out?\r\n\r\nMy online friends are slowly leaving me and they\u2019re like the only people allowing me to cope. What if I hurt someone and ruin my chances of pursuing my dream career that requires going to college.",
        "answer": "I'm gonna be real with you: being put in a psych ward against my will at 16 was slightly traumatic. BUT it was because of my personal circumstances. I was there for one week and I live in Hungary so I have limited experience and knowledge about what you're might be getting into but here's what I know nonetheless. I hope it helps. \r\n\r\nFirst of all I was already going to therapy and had a developing support system that I was taken out of. You on the other hand don't seem to have a stable support system at all and would probably benefit from the attention of professionals and people with similar issues (aka you could even make some friends although in my experience it is a hit or miss. But you will definitely benefit from hearing similar stories from people in similar but just different enough situations, trust me). ***If you feel like you need help you're probably right.*** Getting away from your parents, whatever the exact situation might be would also seem like a good idea based on what you wrote. ***In sum I definitely recommend talking to a therapist and it might even be beneficial for you to go to hospital*** although that depends on the hospital itself. Also you should definitely ask your therapist about being hospitalised, especially if you're afraid to be open because of the uncertainties surrounding it. They will have better answers suited for you than any of us here on reddit. \r\n\r\nI'm not sure about your local place's rules but in my experience and what I heard in other places as well they take your phone away. We had one hour daily to use our phones, which overlapped with the one hour that visitors were allowed so I practically couldn't use it at all because parents always bugged me to pay attention to them lol. Entertainment wise they provided a lot of things, from art supplies through TV to guided activities and even played with us if none of the other patients were willing so I didn't miss social media but I did miss being able to communicate with my friends.\r\n\r\nIf you get put in a hospital ***your legal guardian will know about it.*** I'm not sure if you can prevent them from visiting you as I never had an issue like that but you should talk about a doctor with it. I'm sure you're not the first one who would have an issue like that (if you even want to prevent them. That's just the vibe I got from your post). ***They will also most likely see the reports that the doctors write about you***, which can be very scary, I know. In my experience it doesn't contain very specific things, just general statements. For me these reports (or at least the parts in laymans terms) were 3-4 short paragraphs long where at least one would be taken up by my background (how old I was, what my hobbies were, where I went to school, etc). This was in every report, I assume, for the purpose of informing any other doctor or therapist that might take my case about the basic info needed about me. A report like this was produced after every one-on-one talk, sometimes including psychological tests. The 2nd-3rd paragraphs were taken up by the contents of these talks and tests, again, general tastements, almost bulletpoints about the most important things. The last paragraph would talk about diagnoses, suspected and outruled problems. ***So don't be scared because of this. Having your parents know about stuff is a necessary sacrifice for the betterment of yourself.*** This is also something I had to come to terms with and was very uncomfortable at first. But you have to understand that this is a \"necessary evil\" for things to get better.\r\n\r\n***GOING TO HOSPITAL  WILL NOT RUIN YOUR LIFE*** */in most cases\r\nUnless you get sent to a *very* bad mental hospital that worsens your condition, you will not really lose from this. For the duration of your stay there you will probably not go to school, unless they let you go online, however a lot of the time it's an important point to let people there take a rest from school or work. If that means missing an exam based on how severe your situation is they might just say that you'll have to take it next year. But trust me, they know what they're doing. If they say you need to miss the exam, you're probably better off missing that exam >!than killing yourself over it if you get what I'm saying!<\r\n\r\nRecord of you being there will of course be in your medical records and your GP will probably know about it. I think there are aa few diagnoses and medicines that would prevent you from driving a car for example or if you are very violent they might prevent you from becoming a teacher and prohibit you from getting a firearm. But these are ***extreme cases*** and >!unless you killed or raped someone!< getting a diagnoses will not have any serious negative effects. On the contrary it will greatly help you, your caregivers and your doctors in understanding your problem and its possible solutions so don't shy away from it. \r\n\r\nAlso, I'm not a lawyer but to my knowledge you have zero obligation to disclose your medical history to your regular ol' job provider unless it's relevant to the actual work. If anything this will only help you with overcoming your issues and being more balanced in the future - aka having a better life. ***I can't stress this enough. If you feel like you need help, get help! It will most likely actually help!***\r\n\r\nThroughout this comment I talked about ***inpatient treatment*** aka: you sleep there, eat there, shower there and can't leave unless they let you. Based on your specific circumstances you might be put in ***outpatient care.*** We had one outpatient girl who slept and showered at home. However from ~8-16 (I don't remember the exact time but for the majority of the day) she was mandated to be there in the hospital and follow the same rules as us aka: not leave without supervision unless allowed and follow the activities of the group. She ate with us, etc. but would go home at the end of the day. Whether you go inpatient or outpatient is based on some factors: First and foremost how much of a threat are you to yourself and/or others and how safe are you at home? If you are eligible for both inpatient and outpatient and the hospital has the capacity (aka: enough beds, food, caretakers, etc) they might let you choose what you prefer. After they let me out they said they'd welcome me if I wanted to continue this in outpatient care.\r\n\r\nLast addendum: I saw a lot of people comment bad things about mental health care in the states. I have no experience with that and hearing about the absolute state of american health care saddens me greatly. I might be a bit too optimistic because I had - regardless of some traumas - actual positive experiences with therapists and the hospital I was in. But that's Hungary. Please, ***please*** ask a local professional - either a therapist or your GP - about your situation before getting into all of this! I'm not even sure if you're in the states - regardless, ***ask someone local about this who know their stuff!!! ***\r\n\r\nI hope at least you get some idea about mental hospitals from this! And I really wish for your situation to get better <3 if you have any questions you can also just message me if you'd like, I'll answer everything I can(although I might not be the most experienced) I remember how scary it was not knowing anything that went on.",

I knew of her past eating disorder but I never knew the details. My ex was going through a depressive phase and was eating very poorly. I ignored it because it didn\u2019t bother me. She also suffers from quiet bpd, depression, and anxiety. \r\n\r\nOne night she told me that her mom told her she gained weight. She said she asked her friends and they all denied it. I told her that I noticed it a little and that I think her diet hasn\u2019t been the greatest recently. I offered that we could maybe workout together and support each other. I thought this was a healthy solution but she was extremely hurt and cried. \r\n\r\nThe next morning she told me that she felt unwanted by me and that she tried to harm herself in the past because of her eating disorder. I have never felt so horrible in my life. I apologized and told her that I still find her beautiful and was only trying to help her from letting her health get worse. I\u2019m a very honest and blunt person and I feel like if I don\u2019t offer a solution I feel helpless. \r\n\r\nI now understand that she wasn\u2019t looking for a solution but instead reassurance from me. I told her that I want to learn more about her vulnerable sides so I can be more understanding of what she went through and still struggles with. I suggested maybe she could look into seeing a therapist. \r\n\r\n She thanked me for being so understanding and told me she is happy to have someone like me.

        "answer": "Statistics from the UK's Nat. Inst. for Clinical Evidence: although this is not as effective as seeing a therapist, many people suffering from anxiety benefit from self-help. In recent years, evidence for therapeutic breathing has been very encouraging.\r  \r\n\r  \r\nThe self-help I'm describing here is not complicated.  \r  \r\n\r  \r\nWhen we have a lot of anxiety, it puts worrisome thoughts into our heads. There's two ways to get rid of those thoughts.\r  \r\n \r  \r\nOne is just to calm down. The easiest way to do this is to breathe slowly till you feel OK. Two psychiatrists, Brown and Gerbarg, say a 10 or 20 min slow breathing exercise is good and 20 min twice a day is a therapy for anxiety. The exercise is inhale and exhale gently, 6 seconds each.\r  \r\n\r  \r\nWhen you're calm, you can think your way through a problem instead of just worrying about it. Think about the worst thing that can happen, how likely that is and what you could do if it happens. In a stressful situation, think about the different ways you can respond and decide which one is the most intelligent.\r  \r\n \r  \r\nDon't make mountains out of molehills.\r  \r\n \r  \r\nWhen you use the thinking brain, you get control of the emotional brain, and you feel better.\r  \r\n \r  \r\nAlso, replace negative thoughts with positive thoughts. Count your blessings and remind yourself of your successes.\r  \r\n\r  \r\nThe treatments for anxiety range from simple stress reduction methods to therapy and medication.\r  \r\n\r  \r\nDon't overlook stress management - it can help even with very bad anxiety.\r  \r\n \r  \r\nVideo - a lot of helpful information, including the 3-part program of Brown and Gerbarg -\r  \r\n\r  \r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqEM\\_jlDRZI\r  \r\n\r  \r\n  Freedom from Self-Harm: Overcoming Self-Injury with Skills from DBT and Other Treatments \r  \r\n\r  \r\nThis book has been endorsed by Marsha Linehan, who created DBT, the best treatment for borderline personality disorder, which has serious self-injury as a frequent symptom. \r  \r\n\r  \r\nThere's a wide variety of treatments. Very severe cases require months of intense therapy but many people do well with a treatment that's just a booklet and a few therapy sessions, usually 2 or 3. \r  \r\n\r  \r\nTreatments that only reduce self-harm are considered successful. The less you self-harm the stronger you are and better able to deal with the problems that led to your self-harm.  Likewise, the better you are in dealing with the underlying problems the more it reduces the self-harm.",
